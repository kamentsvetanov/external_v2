function s=num2roman(n)
%NUM2ROMAN Roman numerals.
%   NUM2ROMAN(N) returns modern Roman numeral form of integer N, which can
%	be scalar (returns a string), vector or matrix (returns a cell array of
%	strings, same size as N).
%
%	The function uses strict rules whith substractive notation and commonly
%	found 'MMMM' form for 4000. It includes also parenthesis notation for 
%	large numbers (multiplication by 1000). It considers only the integer
%	part of N.
%
%	Examples:
%		num2roman(1968)
%		num2roman(10.^(0:7))
%		reshape(num2roman(1:100),10,10)
%
%	See also ROMAN2NUM.
