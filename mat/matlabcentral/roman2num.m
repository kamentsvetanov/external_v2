function n=roman2num(x)
%ROMAN2NUM Roman numerals conversion.
%   ROMAN2NUM(X) converts to scalar the string X (or cell array of strings)
%	of modern Roman numerals (lower and upper case).
%
%	The function considers strict rules with parenthesis notation for
%	numbers larger than 4999. Invalid characters will produce NaN.
%
%	Examples:
%		num2roman('MMMMDCCCLXXXVIII')
%		num2roman('(CCCXIV)CLIX')
%
%	See also NUM2ROMAN.
