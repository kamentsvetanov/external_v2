function [X,fVal,exitFlag,solverOutput] = exgauss_fit(y)
% EXGAUSS_FIT fits the ex-Gaussian distribution to a vector of data
%  
% DESCRIPTION 
% Optimizes fits between the data (y) and the ex-Gaussian distribution,
% using maximum likelihood estimation and a bounded Simplex algorithm.
%  
% SYNTAX 
% [X,fVal,exitFlag,solverOutput] = EXGAUSS_FIT(y);
%
% y             - Nx1 vector of observed response times
% X             - 1x3 best-fitting parameter values (mu,sigma,tau)
% fVal          - negative log-likelihood (-fVal is log-likelihood)
% exitFlag      - logical scalar, indicates exit condition of the 
%                 optimization algorithm; if true, the algorithm reached
%                 the pre-specified criteria
% solverOutput  - structure with the information about the optimization:
%                 * number of iterations,
%                 * number of function evaluations
%                 * algorithm
