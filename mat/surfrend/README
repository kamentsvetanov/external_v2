1.0     Welcome to the SPM surfrend toolbox

The SPM surfrend toolbox is a suite of scripts that add surface-based rendering
capabilities to SPM99/2 generated statistical maps. An overview document and
reference guide are provided to show how to use the SPM surfrend toolbox.

2.0     How to cite SPM surfrend toolbox in your publication

If you want to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your research,
you might say something like this,
"For the purpose of additional anatomical precision, group contrasts were
overlaid on a surface based representation of the MNI canonical brain using the
SPM surfrend toolbox (written by I. Kahn; http://spmsurfrend.sourceforge.net)."
If you use FreeSurfer for visualization and figure production please add, "The
surfaces were then rendered using FreeSurfer (CorTechs Labs, Inc., Charlestown,
MA) (Dale, Fischl, & Sereno, 1999; Fischl, Sereno, & Dale, 1999)."

3.0     New Features 

        _____________________________________________________________
        3.1     Analyze format support

        3.1.1   "SPM | Analyze" button and Analyzeimage format  support
        It is possible to load a .img file (e.g., spmT_0002.{img,hdr}) instead 
        of an SPM. Note that now you need to specify a threshold (the default
        is >0 and for an spmT file the numbers will reflect the F value for
        each voxel). Also note that between SPM99 and SPM2, the default analyze
        is flipped. Consequently, you should use the same version of SPM to
        load the Analyze image or flip it manually.

        3.1.2    [0.2.1] Added the function write_wfile to be contained
        within the surfrend functions

        _____________________________________________________________
        3.2     SPM5 support

        Added SPM5 support and officially went out of beta.

4.0     History

        4.0 New Features
        _____________________________________________________________
        4.1     SPM Single subject T1 surface and overlay generation

        4.1.1   FreeSurfer based surface of the SPM Single Subject T1  
        The SPM single subject T1 anatomy was obatained from one of the MNI lab
        members, Colin Holmes, who was scanned 27 times. The scans were
        coregistered and averaged to create a very high detail MRI dataset of
        one brain. This average was also matched to the MNI305, to create the
        image known as "colin27". SPM99/2 uses colin27 as its standard
        template. SPM99/2 contains a 2mm resolution copy of the image, called
        Single_subj_T1.{img,mnc} in the SPM canonical directory.
        Using FreeSurfer, a surface was generated for colin27.

        4.1.2   Surface based SPM Contrast overlay

        The colin27 surface (or FS_spm_CanonicalBrain) is used for the
        transformation of SPM contrast maps normalized to the MNI space to an
        overlay (i.e., w-file). The overlay can be used in combination with
        spm_CanonicalBrain for further rendering.

        4.1.3   Added SPM5 support and officially announced V1.0.
