% If there are no file names, do nothing.
% If file names are entered and full path is not, attempt to find full
% path.
% If full path info is entered, check to see if files exist.
% Return output in obj.files_exist, and print a warning if only some exist.
%
% image names should be stored in .fullpath
% abbreviated image names may be stored in image_names.
%
% Notes:
% fullpath should have full path to each volume in a string matrixm, with
% trailing ,volume# for 4-D images as per SPM style expanded list.
% image_names should have image name only for each volume
%
% *** May still be debugging issues with 3-D vs. 4-D files
