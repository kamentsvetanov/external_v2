% new idea: model nonlinear saturation response as a function of 
% a fixed saturation response (that we know is e.g., 1-(.6658 x original) with a
% stimulus 1 s before) x an exponential discount factor for how LONG AGO the
% previous stimulus occurred
% SO THAT: Rnow = Ro - sum(s(t-to)gamm(t-to)
% gam(1) should be 1-.6658, and area under gam should be no more than 1,
% because you can never lose more than 100% of the signal
% BUT we may end up having to take interactions betwn stim into account,
% which is harder: e.g., a stim occurs .5 s before and another occurs .3
% sec before.  The .3 one is going to produce a smaller response and thus
% less saturation, and you can never saturate more than 1 (100%) even w/
% many stimuli occurring in a short time frame (w/i 1 s)
% SO this model, now, can predict negative response values with more than
% 100% sat.
