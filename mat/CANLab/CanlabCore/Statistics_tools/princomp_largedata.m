%PRINCOMP_LARGEDATA Principal Components Analysis.
%   This is a version created for large data sets by Matthew Davidson
%   The default Matlab PRINCOMP is naive to large data sets. Out-of-memory
%   errors are easily obtained on imaging data. The solution is to replace
%   concise but inefficient calls to repmat with loops and to eliminate
%   large, unused variables.
%
%   Tested on random data sets and produces identical output as original
%   PRINCOMP. Speed penalty is drastic for small data. 50% slower on
%   50x1000 element data set, but on a 50x10000, only 2% slower.
%
%   COEFF = PRINCOMP(X) performs principal components analysis on the N-by-P
%   data matrix X, and returns the principal component coefficients, also
%   known as loadings.  Rows of X correspond to observations, columns to
%   variables.  COEFF is a P-by-P matrix, each column containing coefficients
%   for one principal component.  The columns are in order of decreasing
%   component variance.
%
%   PRINCOMP centers X by subtracting off column means, but does not
%   rescale the columns of X.  To perform PCA with standardized variables,
%   i.e., based on correlations, use PRINCOMP(ZSCORE(X)).  To perform PCA
%   directly on a covariance or correlation matrix, use PCACOV.
%
%   [COEFF, SCORE] = PRINCOMP(X) returns the principal component scores,
%   i.e., the representation of X in the principal component space.  Rows
%   of SCORE correspond to observations, columns to components.
%
%   [COEFF, SCORE, LATENT] = PRINCOMP(X) returns the principal component
%   variances, i.e., the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of X, in
%   LATENT.
%
%   [COEFF, SCORE, LATENT, TSQUARED] = PRINCOMP(X) returns Hotelling's
%   T-squared statistic for each observation in X.
%
%   When N <= P, SCORE(:,N:P) and LATENT(N:P) are necessarily zero, and the
%   columns of COEFF(:,N:P) define directions that are orthogonal to X.
%
%   [...] = PRINCOMP(X,'econ') returns only the elements of LATENT that are
%   not necessarily zero, i.e., when N <= P, only the first N-1, and the
%   corresponding columns of COEFF and SCORE.  This can be significantly
%   faster when P >> N.
