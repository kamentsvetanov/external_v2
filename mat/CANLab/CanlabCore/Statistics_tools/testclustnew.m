% function [bestpval,bestmyclass,bestnames,bestX,where,clustnames]=testclustnew(X,clust,[r],[nperm],[names],[remove],[linkagetype]);
% this function tests for the significance of the cluster solution
%
% inputs: X is the Group Space
%        --- clust is the cluster solutions (between how many and how many solutions is reasonable?)
%         the default for this option is 2:r/2 where r is the number of
%         REGIONS
%        --- r is the number of DIMENSIONS in the solution (from choose_ndims)
%        --- nperm is the number of permutations for nonparametric testing
%         (default 1000)
%        --- names specifies the names of each region
%        --- remove specifies what to do about elements which fit the cluster
%         solution poorly.  There are 3 possibilities:
%         'keep' - keeps all elements regardless of quality.  If you choose
%         this option, you are assuming that every region you enter
%         contributes something to your solution
%         'thresh' - this removes elements which fail to reach 95%
%         confidence as determined by random permutation testing
%         'iter'  - this option removes elements which fall in the bottom
%         5% of the permuted distribution, and remcomputes the solution
%         without these elements. This iterative recomputation means that
%         you are pruning your solution *until* you get a good one.  The
%         p-values which accompany each solution are thus difficult to
%         intepret if you use this option
%        --- linkagetype is the input to linkage ('single','average',etc) 
%         see help linkage_t
%
% outputs:
%        --- bestpval is the overall significance of the derived solution.
%        significance is calculated by permuting the group space in all
%        dimensions to derive a completely new configuration of elements in
%        n-dimensional space.  These elements are then assigned to clusters
%        exactly as for the point estimate solution, and the mean quality
%        (silhouette value) across the entire plot is used to form a
%        distribution against which to test the sihouette value of the true
%        solution
%        --- bestmyclass is the assignment of REGIONS to CLUSTERS for the best
%        soluton
%        --- bestnames contains the names of the REGIONS included in the
%        best solution (if remove==keep, this will be the same as names);
%        --- bestX is the best group space
%        --- where is a vector indexing which of the original regions (in
%        order) are included in the new group space.
%        clustnames is a cell containing the names of the elements in each
%        cluster
%
%        calls:
%        getmeanquality,clustquality,pdist1,linkage_t,cluster_t,makebinary
