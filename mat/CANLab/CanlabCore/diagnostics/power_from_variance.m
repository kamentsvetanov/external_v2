function [power, t, d] = power_from_variance(con, N, sig2b, sig2wi, pthresh)
% Power and effect size measures, given contrast, N, and variance component
% estimates
%
% Input:
% con       contrast/effect magnitude estimate; "mean difference"
% N          sample size
% sig2b    between-subjects variance estimate
% sig2wi   within-subjects variance estimate
%           *note* this is not the "raw" within-subjects variance; it is
%           the contribution to the group (2nd-level) variance, which is
%           sig2within / number of images within-subjects
% pthresh alpha (Type I error) rate; p-value threshold for power
%             calculation
%
% Output:
% power   Power from 0 to 1
% t          effect size : expected t-value
% d          effect size : Cohen's d
%
% con, sig2b, and sig2wi can all be vectors, so you can run this function
% voxel-wise for a whole map at once
% 
% see effect_size_map.m for a whole-brain, image-based power mapping

% t-value threshold for significance at alpha level pthresh
u_unc = tinv(1 - pthresh./2, N);

% expected t-value based on N, con, variance components
t = ( abs(con) .* sqrt(N) ) ./ (sig2b + sig2wi) .^ .5;

d = t ./ sqrt(N);

% power at this alpha level
power = 1 - tcdf(u_unc - t, N - 1);
