<P>
<P>There is not much of a homework for this section of the help. You may
just play around and synthesize the various signals, testing how the
parameters will affect the outputs. Here are however some combinations
worth trying:
<P>
<P><EM>Weierstrass function</EM>
<P>If you have not done so already, try the test mentioned in the
description of the <B>Weierstrass</B> sub-menu. This experiment
highlights some specific difficulties one meets when dealing with
fractal signals. These are due to the fact that such signals are by
definition not band-limited. The classical sampling theory specifies
that the signals should then be low-pass filtered before processing. This
is not always relevant or even possible in our case. As a matter of
fact, a whole new sampling theory is needed for the kind of signals of
interest in multifractal analysis. Indeed, the basic assumption is
that (a part of) the pertinent information in the signal lies in its
regularity structure, e.g. its Hölder function. Low-pass filtering the
signal will transform it into an infinitely smooth one, thus loosing
essential features. It is beyond our scope here to discuss
further this important matter, and we will content ourselves with a
simple experiment: Generate two deterministic Weierstrass functions
with exponent H = 0.2, 256 points, a time support of 1, and a large
lambda, e.g. 25, with both the default sum order and a sum order of
20. Visualize and compare the two synthesized signals and notice that
the first one (let's call it <EM>Wei0</EM>) looks very smooth. This is
clear, since the highest frequency allowed in <EM>Wei0</EM> will be such
that only one term will be included in the summation: <EM>Wei0</EM> is
thus simply a sine function, and as a consequence it has no fractal
features. For instance,it would not make sense to try and estimate a
fractional dimension of <EM>Wei0</EM>. On the other hand, the signal
generated without caring about the sampling theorem does look
irregular. This simple experiment shows that new rules are needed when
one processes "fractal" signals.
<P>

<P>
<P><EM>mBm and generalized Weierstrass function</EM>
<P>
<P>If your machine is sufficiently powerful, try synthesizing some mBm-s
with 512 samples and various Hölder functions. This will help you
understand what exactly the Hölder exponent controls. If synthesizing
512 samples traces of mBm takes ages, do not worry: You can perform
the same kind of experiments using Generalized Weierstrass functions,
either deterministic or stochastic. Try first the default Hölder
functions <B>h(t) = t</B>. Observe the smooth evolution of the pointwise
regularity along the graph, and get a feeling of what it means to have
regularity <EM>t</EM> at each point <EM>t</EM>. Enter then your own functions
and make additional tests.
