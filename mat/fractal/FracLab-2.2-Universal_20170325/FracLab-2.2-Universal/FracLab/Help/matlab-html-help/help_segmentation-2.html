</H2>

<P>
<P>As said in the introduction, this is really a modeling device,
and the application to segmentation is included only
as a example. As a consequence, this sub-menu should be 
viewed mainly as a pedagogical tool. In particular, the
limitation on the position of the segmentation points to
be described below can be removed with some extra-work. 
<P>
<P>The basic idea is to model a 1D signal as a <EM>weakly self-affine</EM>
function. Such functions are generalizations of self-similar functions
where the similarity ratios are allowed to vary at each scale. In
other words, a weakly self-affine function is obtained through a
cascading scheme as follows: assume f is defined on [0,1], and that
its values at the points k/2^n, k=0, .., n are known for a given
n. Then the values of f at the dyadic points k/2^(n+1) can be deduced
using only two "multipliers", c(0,n) and c(1,n). These numbers allow
to compute respectively the left and the right part of the dyadic tree
at level n+1. Thus, the values of f at all points of the form k/2^N is
completely determined from the 2N values (c(0,k),c(1,k)), k=1..N. The
advantage of such a modeling are that it is reasonably compact, and
that it allows to keep track of the fractal properties of the
signal. Indeed, contrarily to a "classical" modeling based, e.g., on
splines, the fractional dimensions, Hölder exponents and
multifractal spectra assume non trivial values. Moreover, all these
characteristics may be computed in an analytical way from the
(c(0,k),c(1,k)), k=1..N.
<P>In general, a given signal will not be well represented by a single
weakly self-affine function. A simple procedure is then applied to
segment the signal into subparts that will be well approximated. In
this procedure, the dyadic tree is recursively divided until each part
is closer to its weakly self-affine approximation than a given
threshold in the L2 norm. We thus end up with a collection of weakly
self-affine functions, defined on a partition of the dyadic tree,
which gives a good representation of the original signal. As a
consequence, we have obtained a segmentation of our signal into parts
which are "multifractally homogeneous", in the sense that each part is
obtained through a simple cascading process.
<P>Let us now proceed to describe the various parameters involved. As
usual, the first line of the sub-menu window displays the signal
currently analyzed, which may be changed by highlighting another
selection in the Variables list in the main window of <B>Fraclab</B>,
and then pressing <B>Refresh</B>. Since the procedure that computes the
weakly self-affine approximation is based on a wavelet decomposition,
you may then choose the <B>analyzing wavelet</B>. In many cases, the
simplest wavelet, i.e. the Haar one, will yield the best results. The
next parameter is the the <B>Analysis depth</B> : as is customary in
wavelet analysis, one usually does not need to analyze all the levels
in the dyadic tree. This parameter lets you choose how many levels you
wish to include, starting from the fine structure. The default is 5:
Usually, you'll get better modeling/segmentation results by leaving
aside the low frequency content of the signal, and process only the
last levels. Of course, you can also try to analyze the whole signal,
in which case you give the maximum depth compatible with the size of
the signal: If it has 2^N points, the depth should be not greater than
N-1, otherwise you will get the message "Error : The maximal analysis
depth is violated" in the <B>Message</B> box of the main window. The
next parameter is the <B>threshold</B> that fixes the maximal error
between a part and its approximation. In other words, if the whole
signal is approximated with an error lower than <B>threshold</B> by a
single weakly self-affine function, no segmentation will take
place. Otherwise, two subtrees will be analyzed, and further
subdivided until the error becomes small enough. Thus, the smaller
<B>threshold</B> is, the more segments you will get, with a more
faithful representation. The last two parameters, <B>c_min</B> and
<B>c_max</B> control the minimum and maximum values of the multipliers
that are to be included in the analysis. Without entering into too
many details, let us say that the multipliers are obtained as ratios
of wavelet coefficients at successive levels. Occasionally, such
ratios may become very small or very large. In such cases, the
representation by weakly self-affine functions is not well adapted,
because it assumes that all the multipliers are close to their mean at
a given level. Since extreme values of the multipliers do not
contribute much to the fractal properties of the representation, it is
best to discard them. More precisely, they are not included in the
analysis, and they are processed independently. The values <B>c_min</B>
and <B>c_max</B> lets you choose the range of the multipliers that will
be used in the analysis. A smaller range means that only a few values
will be processed. In this case, you will usually end up with what
will appear as a good approximation. This is however a fallacious
impression, as only a small fraction of the signal will have been
processed. The box <B> % of the coefficients processed</B> at the bottom
of the sub-menu lets you control how much of the signal has really
been analyzed. A percentage of over 70 is significant, and you should
try to reach 75%. Trying to include too many coefficients will in
general result in poor approximations. To increase the number of
processed coefficients, you may try to change either c_min or c_max,
and see which gives best results in terms of the compromise between a
good approximation and a large enough number of coefficients
processed. It is also worth trying to change the analyzing wavelet,
since multipliers are just ratios of wavelet coefficients, and their
range is heavily dependent on the analyzing wavelet.
<P>Once you hit compute, the <B> % of the coefficients processed</B> will
be updated, and a new window will pop up displaying the original
signal in blue, the weakly self-affine approximation in green and
the segmentation marks as red crosses. Three new signals will have been
added to the <B>Variables</B> list in the main window: <EM>wsamod_synt#</EM>,
where # is a incremental number, is just the weakly self-affine
signal. <EM>wsamod_newci#</EM> contains the vector of multipliers, which you
may want to visualize or use for subsequent processing. In particular,
you may use it to compute analytically the dimensions, multifractal
spectrum and Hölder exponent of the approximation. Finally, <EM>wsamod#</EM> is
a structure used for displaying a graph with appropriate labels and
legend.

</H2>

<P>
<P>The Unix/Linux version of <B>Fraclab</B> running Matlab 5.3 will not let
you process signals whose length is not exactly 2048 (a weird bug,
indeed).
<P>Due to the current implementation based on dyadic wavelets, the
segmentation always takes place at dyadic points. Finally, if the
input signal has length M, only the first 2^N points will be
processed, where N is the largest integer such that 2^N is not larger
than M. The remaining part will simply be ignored.
