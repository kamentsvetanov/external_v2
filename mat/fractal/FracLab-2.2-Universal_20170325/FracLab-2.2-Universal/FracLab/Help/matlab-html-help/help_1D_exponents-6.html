<P>
<P>2-microlocal analysis extends the usual regularity analysis based on
Hölder exponents by associating to each point in the signal an
infinite number of exponents. It is not possible to describe the
details in this help (see reference (3)). We will only mention that
2-microlocal analysis defines, at each point t, a "2-microlocal
frontier", which is a concave decreasing curve in an abstract plane
whose coordinates are denoted (s, s'). The intersection of the
frontier with the s-axis is precisely the local Hölder exponent,
while, under mild assumptions, the intersection with the second
bisector is the pointwise exponent. In addition, 2-microlocal analysis
describes completely what happens under integro-differentiation of the
signal: the frontier is simply translated along the s-axis. This
allows to predict the changes in regularity under various
transformations, most notably the Hilbert transform. Classical
definitions of 2-microlocal analysis involve either a Littlewood-Paley
analysis, or a wavelet analysis. There also exist purely time domain
definitions, which however only yield a sub-part of the 2-microlocal
frontier. These time domain definitions are advantageous because they
allow to design robust estimation procedures. These in turn yield
estimators of both the pointwise and local exponents, which are in
many cases better than direct methods.  Two such methods are currently
implemented in <B>Fraclab</B>.

</H2>

<P>
<P>Hit first <B>Refresh</B> so that the <B>name</B> and <B>size</B> boxes get
updated. The <B>window</B> parameter will, as usual, define the number
of sample points that will be used for estimating the exponents at any
given point t : exactly 0.5 <B>window</B> points will be taken into
account on each side of t. The <B>step</B> parameter lets you decide the
spacing between consecutive points were the exponents will be
computed. Thus, choosing <B>step</B> equal to 1 means that you wish to
perform the estimation at each point. More precisely, the routine will
compute the estimations at the following points, assuming your signal
is (t(1), ..., t(n)): The first point to be considered will be t(0.5
<B>window</B> + 1).  Then all points of the form t(0.5 <B>window</B> + 1 +
<B>step</B>) will be dealt with, until the index (0.5 <B>window</B> + 1 +
<B>step</B>) exceeds n - 0.5 <B>window</B> -1. Let us take the example of
the default values which are <B>window</B> = <B>step</B> = n. In this
case, the computations will be performed only at the middle point 0.5n
of your input signal, using the whole signal as a window. In general,
you will want to choose a large value for <B>window</B>, i.e. at least
100, and preferably 200. Note however that a large window size implies
long computing times (for <B>window</B> = <B>step</B> = n = 256, you
should wait about one minute).The actual number of points where the
estimation will be performed will then depend on both the <B>step</B>
parameter (choosing <B>step</B> not smaller than n implies that only one
point will be considered) and the length n of your signal.
<P>You then need to choose what to <B>estimate</B>: The default is
<B>frontier</B>. When you hit <B>Compute</B>, you will, if you are patient
enough, get three output signals: <EM>Gfrd_sig#</EM> is a graph structure
containing the abscissa and ordinates in the (s, s') plane of the 2
microlocal frontier. This is the signal you may want to visualize. The
second output, <EM>frd_sig#</EM>, is the plain frontier. Finally,
<EM>lend_sig#</EM> is a graph that lets you check the quality of the
estimation.  Briefly, the method works by locating the abscissa s of
the plateau with maximal length in a certain graph. In order for the
procedure to be robust, there should be a well defined maximal length
plateau in <EM>lend_sig#</EM>. Since there is a different graph for each
value of s', <EM>lend_sig#</EM> will contain several piecewise constant
lines, and the estimation will work well if each of these lines has a
well defined maximal length plateau. You may check this by viewing
this output (see (7) for more on this algorithm). In general, the
frontier <EM>frd_sig#</EM>, being an estimated one, will not be concave
and decreasing as predicted by the theory. The <B>Make the frontier
convex</B> part of the menu allows to force this, and thus to obtain more
meaningful results. Select <EM>frd_sig#</EM> in the Variables list, then
hit <B>Refresh</B> (in the <B>Make the frontier convex</B> part of the
window) so that the <B>name</B> of the input signal becomes
<EM>frd_sig#</EM>. You may then adjust the <B>s' cut-off</B> : this is the
ordinate of the first point that will be processed. More precisely,
only the part of the estimated frontier whose points have coordinates
(s, s') with s' <EM>smaller</EM> than the chosen cut-off will be
considered and convexified. As a consequence, the output obtained on
pressing <B>Convexify</B>, called <B>conv_frd_sig#</B>, will be the convex
envelope of the sub-part of the frontier with s' &lt; cut-off.  The
default cut-off of 0 is usually a relevant choice, because the
estimation method only guarantees to have meaningful results for the
part of the frontier between the s axis and the second bissector s' =
-s. Moreover, the two main values we are interested in are the
intersection of the frontier with the s axis (local Hölder exponent)
and with the second bisector (pointwise exponent).
<P>If you have chosen to estimate a frontier, it generally makes sense to
perform the estimation at one or only a few points. Otherwise, the
outputs will be quite messy, with different lines crossing in a
complicated manner.  However, all the computations, including the
convexification, work in the same way in the case of multiple
frontiers. Of course, the <EM>lend_sig#</EM> output becomes very difficult to
read.
<P>Instead of estimating a frontier, you may estimate the <B>local</B> or
<B>pointwise</B> exponent.  In that view, click on the default
<B>frontier</B> to the right of <B>estimate</B>, and choose either
<B>local</B> or <B>pointwise</B>. <B>Fraclab</B> will then estimate the part
of the frontier around the s axis and the second bisector, and will
extract the values of the local and pointwise exponents for you.  The
output will then be the graph of the chosen exponent, or, more
precisely, a 1D signal giving the estimated exponents at the points
where the computations were performed. In these cases, you will in
general want to estimate with a <B>step</B> size of 1 on order to get
the exponents at each point whose index lies between : 0.5 <B>window</B> + 1
and : n - 0.5 <B>window</B> - 1.  For both <B>local</B> or <B>pointwise</B>,
the lower part of the window (the <B>Make the frontier convex</B> part)
is grayed out. You just need to click the <B>Compute</B> button, and you'll get
two outputs : <EM>Gloc_sig#</EM> and <EM>lenlocd_sig#</EM> for the local exponent, and
<EM>Gpt_sig#</EM> and <EM>lenptd_sig#</EM> for the pointwise one. <EM>Gloc_sig#</EM> and
<EM>Gpt_sig#</EM> contain the estimated Hölder exponents, while <EM>lenlocd_sig#</EM>
and <EM>lenptd_sig#</EM> are again plots of the plateaus, which allow to check
that a meaningful maximal plateau was detected.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Oscillation-based (2)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>For this routine, we have chosen to have two separate sub-menus, one
for the estimation at one point and one for the estimation on an
interval. This is mainly for interface presentation purpose, as the
algorithms are the same.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 One point estimation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Hit first <B>Refresh</B> so that the <B>Input Signal</B> gets updated.  In
the part <B>2-microlocal frontier estimation</B>, choose the <B>Point
to analyze</B> by entering its index in the box facing it. The default is
the point right at the middle of your signal. You may then choose the
<B>Discretization</B> of the frontier, i.e. the number of values s' at
which the corresponding s will be estimated. Be warned that this
method can be quite lengthy, and that its time complexity is linear in
the number of values of s'. The remaining part of the window deals
with the type and presentation of the <B>Results</B>. First, decide if
you wish to see an <B>Example of estimation</B> in the <B>Graphs to be
plotted</B> part. As in the previous method, the algorithm works by
detecting significant straight lines in a certain abstract
space. Choosing <B>Yes</B> will let <B>Fraclab</B> display a graph in
which you may want to check that a significant linear part is present
(this linear part is materialized by a blue line, see reference (8)
for details). Then, you need to decide if you want the algorithm to
compute the local and pointwise exponents. In the <B>Regularity
exponents</B> part, choose <B>Yes</B> or <B>No</B> to the right of
<B>Compute the exponents</B>.  If you choose <B>No</B>, you will only get
the frontier, a signal called <EM>Graph_frt_sig#</EM>, which will be both
saved in the <B>Variables</B> list and displayed on the screen (another
signal is sent to the <B>Variables</B> list, <EM>frt_sig#</EM>, which
contains only the s-values in the frontier). <EM>Graph_frt_sig#</EM> is
really a graph structure: <EM>Graph_frt_sig#.data1</EM> contains the
s-values of the frontier, while <EM>Graph_frt_sig#.data2</EM> contains the
s'-values). On the display, the frontier appears as a set of small
triangles connected by straight segments. In addition the two lines s'
= -s and s' = 1 -s are plotted. This is because this estimation
procedure is only valid for the part of the frontier between these two
lines.  In addition, displaying the second bisector helps locating the
pointwise Hölder exponent.
<P>If you choose <B>Yes</B> for <B>Compute the exponents</B>, you'll get in addition
the estimated values of the <B>Pointwise exponent</B>, as obtained with
two slightly different methods, and of the <B>Local exponent</B>, which
will appear in the boxes in front of the corresponding labels. Also,
these values will be saved in the <B>Variables</B> list,
under the names <EM>pw1Exp_sig#</EM>, <EM>pw2Exp_sig#</EM>, and
<EM>locExp_sig#</EM> (these are 1x1 matrices).  In this sub-menu, only one
point is processed, and you get one value for each exponent.
<P>Finally, since some computations are lengthy, you may decide to see
the <B>Waitbar on screen</B> by choosing <B>Yes</B> in the lower part of
the window.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Interval estimation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Basically, this is the same as above, except now you may perform
estimation as several consecutive points of your original signal.  The
only difference are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> In the <B>2-microlocal frontier estimation</B> part, you choose the
<B>Starting point of the analysis</B> and <B>Ending point of the
analysis</B> instead of the <B>Point to analyze</B>. By defaults, these are
the points n/2 -10 and n/2 +10 if n is the length of your input signal,
i.e. 21 points will be analyzed in the middle of the signal.
</LI>
<LI> The sub-part <B>Regularity exponents</B> is now titled <B>Plotting
the Regularity exponents</B>. Because you will get three exponents at
each point (two different estimates of the pointwise exponent, plus a
local exponent), the routine will not display numerical values as in
the case of the <B>One point estimation</B> routine. Instead, it will
save the Hölder functions in the <B>Variables</B> list, and will also
display them on the screen.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>When the computations are over, three graphic windows appear on the
screen: the two first ones display the pointwise exponents as
estimated with two slightly different procedures, and the third one
display the local Hölder function. In abscissa, you can check that the
exponents were estimated between the <B>Starting point of the
analysis</B> and <B>Ending point of the analysis</B>. In addition, four
signals have been added to the <B>Variables</B> list: <EM>Frt_sig#</EM> are the
estimated frontiers are each analyzed point. <EM>Pw1Exp_sig#</EM> and
<EM>Pw2Exp_sig#</EM> are the pointwise Hölder functions, and <EM>LocExp_sig#</EM> is
the estimated local one.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 Known bugs</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>In the first oscillation-based method for estimating 2 microlocal
exponents, the # in the <EM>lend_sig#</EM> output does not increment. Thus
you need to be careful and rename this signal if you plan to use it
afterwards. Also, the currently highlighted signal in the Variables
window is <EM>lend_sig#</EM> after the computation is completed. Thus you'll
find that your newly estimated frontiers are at the bottom of the list
as usual, while your selection will be located above them.
<P>In the second oscillation-based method for estimating 2 microlocal
exponents, the # in all output signals does not always increment. The
same remarks apply. In addition, in the case of estimation at multiple
points, only the s-values are saved in the frontiers. This is not very
convenient. However, you will generally want to estimate frontiers at
single points. Otherwise, use the first method <B>Oscillation based
(1)</B> that does not have this drawback.
