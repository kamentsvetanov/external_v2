<P>
<P>We gather in this section a number of basic facts about the general
behaviour of <B>Fraclab</B>.
<P>In many instances, you will have to choose the <EM>size</EM> of the signal you
want to generate or process. Most of the time, you can either use 
predefined values (often, these will be powers of 2), or simply type
any positive integer in the appropriate zone.
<P>When you process the signal called <EM>sig</EM> with routine <EM>rout</EM>,
the output signal (if any) will be called <EM>rout_sig#</EM>, where # is a
number initially set to 0 and that increments each time you launch the
same procedure on the same input signal.
<P>Most windows at the final level (i.e. the ones that will actually
launch computations) display three buttons in their lower part :
<B>Compute</B> will launch the requested computation, <B>Help</B> will
open a window displaying the technical help associated with the
<B>Fraclab</B> routine involved, and <B>Close</B>.
<P>When you choose a sub-menu that will take a signal or structure as an
input, <B>Fraclab</B> assumes most of the times that the signal you want
to process is the one that is highlighted when you call the sub-menu
window. Thus, sometimes you will get an error if you have not been
careful and checked that the current signal is in the right format for
the routine. Assume for instance that you synthesize a Weierstrass
function.  You will get two outputs: <EM>Wei#</EM> is a 1D signal, while
<EM>GraphWei#</EM> is a graph, i.e. a structure composed of 5
elements. However, when the synthesis is completed, the current
variable is <EM>GraphWei#</EM>. Thus, if you launch for instance <B>GIFS
based estimation</B> in the <B>Pointwise Hölder Exponent</B> sub-menu of
the <B>1D Exponents Estimation</B>, you'll get a beep and an error
message. This is because <B>GIFS based estimation</B> only knows how to
process 1D signals and cannot deal with complicated structures like
<EM>GraphWei#</EM>. Thus, you should select in the <B>Variables</B> list
<EM>Wei#</EM> before you launch <B>GIFS based estimation</B>. In any case,
it is always a good idea to check the <B>Message</B> zone of the main
window if you suspect something fishy happened or if you don't get
what you expected. Do not forget to <B>Erase</B> a message once you have
read it.
<P>Finally, note that in this help file, <B>Fraclab</B> commands,
sub-windows names and parameters appear in <B>boldface</B>, while output
signals are <EM>italicized</EM>.
