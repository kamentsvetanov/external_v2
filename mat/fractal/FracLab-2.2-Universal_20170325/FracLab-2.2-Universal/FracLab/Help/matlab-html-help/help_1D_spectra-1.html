<P>
<P>This menu allows you estimate to various multifractal spectra for 1D
signals. Multifractal spectra for images may also be computed in
<B>Fraclab</B>: Choose the <B>Segmentation</B> menu, and then <B>Image
multifractal segmentation</B>. We refer to the help corresponding to this
window for further details.
<P>There exists three main multifractal spectra: The Hausdorff, large
deviation, and Legendre spectra. Basically, any of the three spectra
provides an information as to which singularities occur in
your signal, and which are dominant: a spectrum is a 1D curve, where
abscissa represents the Hölder exponents actually present in your
signal, and ordinates are related to "the amount" of points where you
will encounter a given singularity. For instance, if the spectrum f has
just one maximum at exponent a, with f(a) = 1, then if you pick a
point at random in the signal, it will almost surely have exponent
a. If b is such that f(b) = 0, then there is a very sparse set of
points which have exponent b. An exponent c which does not occur has
f(c) = -infinity.
<P>This is the rough picture. There are essential differences between the
three spectra, that we cannot detail in this help. We just briefly
mention their main features.
<P>The Hausdorff spectrum gives
geometrical information pertaining to the dimension of sets of points
in a signal having a given Hölder exponent. This is the most precise
spectrum from a mathematical point of view, but is also unfortunately
the most difficult to estimate. We hope to incorporate an estimator of
this spectrum for 1D signals in forthcoming versions of
<B>Fraclab</B>. Note that in the <B>Image multifractal segmentation</B>
sub-menu of the <B>Segmentation</B> window, such a estimator is already
proposed.
<P>The second spectrum is the large deviation spectrum, denoted fg. This
spectrum yields a statistical information, related to the probability
of finding a point with a given Hölder exponent in the signal.  More
precisely, fg measures how this probability behaves under changes of
resolution. 
<P>The third spectrum is the Legendre spectrum, denoted fl. It is just a
concave approximation to the large deviation spectrum. Its main
interest is that it usually yields much more robust estimates, though
at the expense of a loss of information. 
<P>The <B>1D signals Multifractal Spectra</B> allows you to compute fl and
fg for 1D signals which are either measures (i.e. arrays of non
negative data adding up to 1) or functions.
