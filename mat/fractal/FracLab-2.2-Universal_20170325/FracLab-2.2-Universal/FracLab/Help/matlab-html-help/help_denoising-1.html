<P>
<P>The Denoising menu includes various routines that allow to both
denoise and regularize 1D and 2D data. Except for the well-known
wavelet shrinkage, all other methods are based on a manipulation of
the Hölder regularity of the input signal. The basic idea is as
follows: it is intuitively clear that any signal that has at least
some amount of regularity will undergo a decrease of its Hölder
exponents when noise is added. Denoting X the original signal, B the
noise, and Y the observations, we shall have that, in general, the
<EM>estimated</EM> exponents of Y are "in between" those of X and B (this
is not true of the theoretical exponents). A plausible denoising
procedure is then to look for a signal Z which would minimize the risk
subject to the constraint that its regularity is close the one of
X. Usually, of course, the regularity of X is not known. We will thus
be content with imposing equalities of the form: regularity of Z =
regularity of Y + shift, or: regularity of Z = (regularity of Y)(1 +
shift), where "shift" is some positive parameter. The same approach
makes senses in a regularization framework: one then seeks a signal Z
close to Y and with prescribed regularity. For various reasons, it is
much easier to consider regularity in the sense of local Hölder
exponents than pointwise ones. To allow for simple algorithms, the
method is wavelet-based, i.e. we estimate regularity with the help of
wavelet coefficients. These are modified and the updated coefficients
are used to reconstruct the smoothed signal (an alternative algorithm
based on the use of genetic algorithms will hopefully be implemented
in future releases of <B>Fraclab</B>).
<P>In the current implementation of the denoising/regularization
algorithms, you may deal with both 1D and 2D signals, in a transparent
way: Just input your signal, and <B>Fraclab</B> will recognize its type.
