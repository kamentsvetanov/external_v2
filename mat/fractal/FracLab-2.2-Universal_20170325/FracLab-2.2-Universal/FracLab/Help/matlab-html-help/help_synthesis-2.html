<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Stochastic</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="fBm"><H3>fBm</H3></A>

<P>This functionality allows to generate a fractional Brownian motion
using the Cholesky method and a Durbin Levinson algorithm.  You may
choose <B>the Hölder exponent</B> (a real number strictly between 0 and
1), which governs both the pointwise regularity and the shape around 0
of the power spectrum, the <B>sample size</B> (use the predefined values
for powers of 2 or simply type any positive integer in the white zone),
and finally the <B>random seed</B> : this is useful when you need to
generate the same path several times or if you want to compare the
paths of two fBm-s which correspond to the same random event but with
different H.  The output is a one dimensional vector named
<EM>fBm#</EM>, where "#" is incremented by 1 from 0 each time you create
a new path.
<P>See references (1) and (2) for more on this topic.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="mBm"><H3>mBm</H3></A>

<P>This functionality allows to generate an approximation of a
multifractional Brownian motion. This stochastic process is a
generalization of fBm where the parameter H is allowed to vary
along the path instead of remaining fixed : this means that H is now a
function H(t) instead of being a real number.  This is useful if you
need to model a process the pointwise regularity of which varies in
time, since H(t) will indeed be almost surely the regularity of the
mBm at t, under certain smoothness conditions on H. Compared to the
fBm generation window, the only difference is that you now want to
prescribe a Hölder function H instead of a Hölder exponent ; there are
two ways of doing this. Either use one of the two pre-defined choices
: <B>piecewise constant</B> will generate an mBm with H=0.2 on the first
half of the support and H=0.8 on the second half, and <B>h(t)=t</B> will
generate an mBm with Hölder exponent t at point t. Or define your own
H function, in which case you select <B>user defined</B> in the menu and
simply type your function (in the same way you would do it on a Matlab
command line) in the white zone below, after having erased the given
example.  Any continuously differentiable H function with values
between 0 and 1 will yield an mBm with pointwise regularity equal to
H(t) at point t almost surely. The output is a vector, called
<EM>mBm#</EM>.
<P>Remark : since the Cholesky Levinson algorithm is somewhat slow 
and this routine
generates as many fBm-s as there points in the signal, computing times can get
very large for paths with more than a few hundreds of points (see reference (3)).
<P>
<P>Try the choice <B>h(t)=t</B> to get a feeling of what it means for a process to
have smoothly increasing regularity.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Wavelet_based"><H3>Wavelet based 1/f process</H3></A>

<P>This allows to generate a "1/f" process by specifying its wavelet 
coefficients : at scale j, the coefficients are iid random variables
following a centered Gaussian law with variance 2^j(-2H+1), where H is
as usual the Hölder exponent, and coefficients at different scales 
are independent. You first choose the <B>Wavelet</B> type in a list, then the
<B>Hölder exponent</B> between 0 and 1, the <B>Sample Size</B> and finally
the <B>Random Seed</B>. The output
is a vector, <EM>Wfbm#</EM> (reference (4)). 
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Stable_motion"><H3>Stable motion</H3></A>

<P>A stable motion is a process with i.i.d increments which follow a
stable law. Stable laws are a generalization of the Gaussian, in the
sense that they are the only laws that are preserved under
convolutions. Except for the Gaussian, stable laws do not have a
variance, and there exists a real number alpha in (0,2) such that all
moments of order equal to or greater than alpha do not exist. The most
well known non Gaussian stable law is the Cauchy law.
<P>In this menu, you can synthesize a stable process by specifying the
four parameters characterizing the stable law governing its
increments. The <B>Characteristic Exponent</B>, alpha, between 0 and 2,
controls the thickness of the tail of the process. alpha equal 1 gives
the Cauchy law, and alpha lower than or equal to one yields a process
without a mean. The <B>Skewness Parameter</B> is between -1
(distribution totally skewed to the left) and 1 (distribution totally
skewed to the right), and controls the symmetry : the distribution is
symmetric (around its location parameter) if and only if the skewness
parameter is 0. The <B>Location Parameter</B>, which is simply the mean
when alpha is greater than 1, is any real number. Finally, the
<B>Scale Parameter</B> is a positive number related to the "size" of the
distribution : multiplying the process by a positive number w results
in a multiplication of the scale parameter by w.  When alpha equals 2
(Gaussian case), the square of the scale parameter is simply the
variance divided by 2 (see reference (5) for more).
<P>Once the computation is over, two signals are generated : the stable process
itself, named <EM>stable_process#</EM> and its increments, which are iid realizations
of a stable law, <EM>stable_increments#</EM>. Both are vectors.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="SGIFS"><H3>SGIFS</H3></A>

<P>An SGIFS or semi-generalized Iterated Function System is a set of
functions that allows to generate a fractal curve interpolating a
finite number of points with control on the box dimension of the
graph,and its multifractal spectrum.  The graph is generated through
an iterative procedure, starting from the interpolation points and
applying iteratively the functions of the SGIFS. At level or iteration
k, 2^k functions are applied. Within <B>fltool</B>, the number of
<B>Interpolation points</B> is fixed to three.  You enter the (x,y)
coordinates of these points on the first line. Since the functions of
the SGIFS are restricted to be affine in this implementation (although
a much wider class of operators may be used in general), and because
of graph continuity constraints, each function has only one free
parameter, called here the <B>Contraction factor</B>. You may enter two
numbers in these fields, c1 and c2, which will correspond to the mean
of this factor for respectively functions of odd and even ranks. These
means are numbers with absolute value between 0.5 and 1.  At each step
k (the number of these steps is the parameter <B>Number of
Iterations</B> on the third line), 2^k contraction factors are generated
according to a normal or uniform law, depending on your choice of the
<B>Probability law</B>, with mean c1 for factors of odd rank and c2 for
factors of even rank, and variance j^(-var), where var is the
<B>Variance decrease exponent</B>, a positive real. To each of these
factors corresponds an affine function, which is applied to a part of
the currently generated graph according to rules described in the
references (6) and (7).
<P>For large values of the <B>Variance 
decrease exponent</B>, large (close to +-1) values of c1 and c2 
yield irregular graphs, while values of c1/c2 close to +-0.5 
generate "smoother" graphs.  Values of the <B>Variance 
decrease exponent</B> close to 0 add variability at small scales and 
"burstiness" in the graphs.
<P>The number of points of the synthesized graph is 2^(number of iterations) + 1.
The outputs consist in <EM>sgifs_ord_#</EM>, a vector containing 
the synthesized function, <EM>sgifs_ci_#</EM>, a vector containing the randomly
chosen contraction factors, and <EM>sgifs_#</EM>, a structure used for internal 
purposes.

<P>
<A NAME="Weierstrass"><H3>Weierstrass</H3><A>

<P>The Weierstrass function is one of the first instances of a continuous
nowhere differentiable function (reference (8)). It is basically a sum
of damped sines with increasing frequencies. Its <B>Hölder exponent</B>
H is the same at each point, and you can enter any value between 0 and
1 for H in the first line. The <B>Sample size</B> controls the length of
the generated signal.  The <B>lambda</B> parameter governs the spacing
between adjacent frequencies : The n-th frequency is simply lambda^n.
In this stochastic version, the damping factor, lambda^(-h*n), of the
n-th frequency component is multiplied by a Gaussian random variable
with mean 0 and variance 1. In addition a uniformly distributed random
phase is added to each sine.  The signal will be generated on the
interval (0, <B>time support</B>).  The <B>Sum order</B> is the number of
terms effectively computed in the sum of sines (which theoretically
contains infinitely many terms). If you plan to use Fourier tools for
the analysis of this signal, it is advised to choose a value such that
the synthesized signal will meet the hypotheses of the sampling
theorem (this is the <B>Default</B>, so that you don't need to perform
the calculation yourself). If on the contrary you will operate with
time-domain analyzing tools, you'll get better results by choosing a
much higher value for the sum order than the default, typically around
20. If you are not sure, go for the higher value, which will give more
relevant results in general (see the help on the deterministic
Weierstrass for more on this topic). Thus, in this particular case,
the default should be changed in most cases. The output <EM>Wei#</EM> is a
vector containing the synthesized function.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Generalized_Weierstrass"><H3>Generalized Weierstrass</H3></A>

<P>This is an easy generalization of the classical Weierstrass function
where you can control, under some conditions, the Hölder exponent at
each point (reference (7)): You choose the <B>Hölder function</B>, either from one of
the two pre-defined choices (<B>piecewise constant</B> or linear, i,e,
<B>h(t)=t</B>), or you select <B>user defined</B> and type in your own
regularity function following the example given in the dialog box. Any
continuously differentiable H function with values between 0 and 1
will yield a signal with pointwise regularity equal to H(t) at point
t.  The other parameters are as in the "Weierstrass Function
Synthesis" menu. The output is vector named <EM>Gwei#</EM>.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="2D_stationary"><H3>2D stationary increments</H3></A>

<P>This sub-menu allows to generate a 2D random field with stationary
increments. The first parameter is the <B>Hölder exponent</B>, which
controls as usual the smoothness of the image. The <B>Matrix Size</B>
parameter lets you choose the size of the field : Values larger than
256 will result in quite long computing times. Finally, the
<B>Structure Fcn</B> parameter (for structure function) controls the anisotropy : at this
time, only the "fBm" structure function is available, yielding an
isotropic 2D fractional Brownian motion (reference (9)). The output is a square
matrix, called <EM>StInc2D#</EM>.

<A NAME="SelfReg"><H3>Self-Regulating multifractal processes</H3></A>

<P>Self-regulating multifractal processes are processes whose regularity is a deterministic function of the value. </P>
<UL>
<LI>For 1D-SRMP, you can choose between the following methods: fbm-based or midpoint displacement. 2D-SRMP are generated by the fbm-based method.</LI>
<LI>The g(Z) function is the function linking the regularity exponent to the value of the function: alpha=g(Z). This function must take its value between 0 and 1.</LI>
<LI> You can choose the sample size of the signal.</LI>
<LI> If you choose the fbm-based method, it is possible to prescribe the shape of the signal, which means that the signal takes its value be near a regular function. The higher the mixing parameter, the nearer the signal is from the shape.</LI>
<LI> If you choose the mid-point method, it is possible to prescribe the first value and the last value of the signal. The amplitude parameter influences the variations of the output signal.</LI>

<P>
<A NAME="ss2.2.1"><H3>IFS</H3></A>

<P>An IFS or Iterated Function System is a set of functions that allows
to generate a fractal curve interpolating a finite number of points
with control on the box dimension of the graph and its global Hölder
regularity (reference (10)). The graph is generated through an iterative procedure,
starting from the interpolation points and applying iteratively the
functions of the IFS. You first choose any number of <B>Interpolation
points</B> by giving their (x,y) coordinates. The number of functions in
the IFS will be the number N of interpolations points minus 1.  Since
the functions of the IFS are restricted to be either affine or sine
polynomial in this implementation (although a much wider class of
operators may be used in general), and because of graph continuity
constraints, each function has only one free parameter, called here
the <B>Contraction factor</B>. You may thus enter N-1 <B>Contraction factors</B>,
which should be real numbers with absolute value between 1/(N-1) and 1. Large
values result in irregular graphs, while small values gives smoother graphs.
More precisely, the almost sure Hölder exponent of the graph is the base
N-1 logarithm of the product of the contraction factors, divided by -N+1.
The <B>Number of points</B> gives the length of the graph, and the <B>IFS type</B>
lets you choose between affine functions and sine polynomials for the IFS.
The output consists in <EM>ifs_ord_#</EM>, a vector containing 
the synthesized function, and <EM>ifs_#</EM>, a structure used for internal 
purposes.

<P>
<A NAME="ss2.2.2"><H3>GIFS</H3></A>

<P>A GIFS or Generalized Iterated Function System is a set of functions
that allows to generate a fractal curve interpolating a finite number
of points with control on the box dimension of the graph, its
multifractal spectrum, and even its pointwise Hölder regularity (reference (7)). The
graph is generated through an iterative procedure, starting from the
interpolation points and applying iteratively the functions of the
GIFS. At level or iteration k, 2^k functions are applied. Within
<B>fltool</B>, the number of <B>Interpolation points</B> is fixed to
three.  You enter the (x,y) coordinates of these points on the first
line. You enter next the <B>Hölder function</B>, which will rule the
Hölder exponent of the graph at each point. You may use one of the
three pre-defined choices : <B>piecewise constant</B>, <B>h(t)=t</B>, or
<B>|sin(3Pi*t)|</B>, or define your own regularity function by selecting
<B>user defined</B> and following the example given in the dialog
box. The <B>Hölder function</B> should be a continuous function between 0
and 1.  The parameter <B>Number of iterations</B> controls the length of
the synthesized graph : 2^(Number of iterations) points will be
generated.  The output consists in <EM>prescribedH_ord_#</EM>, a vector
containing the synthesized function, and <EM>prescribedH_#</EM>, a structure
used for internal purposes.

<A NAME="ss2.2.3"><H3>Weierstrass</H3></A>

<P>The Weierstrass function is one of the first instances of a continuous
nowhere differentiable function (reference (8)). It is basically a sum
of damped sines with increasing frequencies. Its <B>Hölder exponent</B>
H is the same at each point, and you can enter any value between 0 and
1 for H in the first line. The <B>Sample size</B> controls the length of
the generated signal.  The <B>lambda</B> parameter governs the spacing
between adjacent frequencies : the n-th frequency is simply
lambda^n. Its damping factor is lambda^(-H*n).  The signal will be
generated on the interval (0, <B>time support</B>).  The <B>Sum order</B>
is the number of terms effectively computed in the sum of sines (which

choosing a much higher value for the sum order than the default,
typically around 20. If you are not sure, go for the higher value,
which will give more relevant results in general. The following simple
test tells you why: Generate two Weierstrass functions with exponent H
= 0.2, 256 points, a time support of 1, and a large lambda, e.g. 25,
with both the default sum order and a sum order of 20. Visualize and
compare the two synthesized signal and notice that the first one looks
very smooth. This explains why, in this particular case, the default
should be changed in most cases.
<P>The output <EM>Wei#</EM> is a vector containing the synthesized function.

<P>
<A NAME="ss2.2.4"><H3>Generalized Weierstrass</H3></A>

<P>This is an easy generalization of the classical Weierstrass function
where you can control, under some conditions, the Hölder exponent at
each point (reference (7)): You choose the <B>Hölder function</B>, either from one of
the two pre-defined choices (<B>piecewise constant</B> or linear, i,e,

continuously differentiable H function with values between 0 and 1
will yield a signal with pointwise regularity equal to H(t) at point
t.  The other parameters are as in the "Weierstrass Function
