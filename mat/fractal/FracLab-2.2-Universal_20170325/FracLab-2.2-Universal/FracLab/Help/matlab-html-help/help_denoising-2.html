<H2><A NAME="s2">2. The <B>Multifractal Pumping</B> sub-menu</A></H2>

<P>
<P>The most obvious way to increase the local Hölder regularity by an
amount d is simply to multiply all the wavelet coefficients at scale j
by 2^(-dj). This roughly amounts to performing a fractional
integration of order d (indeed, the local Hölder exponent is related
to a notion of local fractional derivative). This sub-menu does
exactly this. You just have to select the <B>Analyzed signal</B> and to
adjust a <B>Spectrum shift value</B>, either by entering a value or by
using the arrows. The spectrum shift value is the parameter d
mentioned above (the justification for this denomination is that all
exponents are increased by d, thus the whole multifractal spectrum is
shifted to the right by an amount of d), and hit <B>Compute</B>. The
output will be called <EM>den_signal#</EM>, and will be a regularized version
of your original (1D or 2D) signal. It is interesting to note that you
can input negative values for d, so that you may decrease the
regularity of your signal. Also, this procedure is fully reversible,
except for numerical round-offs. Try a large positive value for d
(e.g. 4). The result will be a very blurred signal, which seems to
contain almost no information. Since the blurred signal is the
currently selected one in the <B>Variables</B> list, hit <B>Refresh</B> so
that the denoising algorithm knows that you now want to process
another signal. Select -d as a spectrum shift. You will recover your
original signal.
<P>Note finally that typical values for the shift in this case are around 0.5.
