<P>
<P>We have already used some of the routines of the estimation menu in
the homework section of the <B>Overview and main functionalities</B> of
this help.
<P>We will here compare the various methods for estimating the local and
pointwise exponent <EM>functions</EM> (i.e. the exponents at all points of
the signal) on a test signal, namely a generalized Weierstrass
function with linearly increasing regularity. In that view, first
synthesize this signal: Go to
<B>Synthesis</B>/<B>Functions</B>/<B>Deterministic</B>/<B>Generalized
Weierstrass</B>. Choose <B>h(t)=t</B> as a <B>Hölder Function</B>. Set the
<B>Sample size</B> to 1024, leave <B>lambda</B> unchanged, and set the
<B>Sum Order</B> to 30. Hit <B>Compute</B> to obtain the signal
<EM>Gwei0</EM>. <B>View</B> it in the usual way, and notice how the
regularity visibly increases from left to right.
<P>The signal <EM>GWei0</EM> has, at all point t in (0,1), both local and
pointwise exponent equal to t. We shall see that estimating the
regularity exponents is not an easy task in general, and that some
methods give an acceptable result on this particular signal. We shall
first test the CWT method: Go to <B>1D Exponents
Estimation</B>/<B>Pointwise Holder Exponent</B>/<B>CWT based estimation</B>.
In the window that appears, click on <B>Advanced compute</B>. Now
compute the CWT of <EM>GWei0</EM> as explained above: Check first that the
<B>Input Signal</B> is indeed <EM>GWei0</EM>, otherwise <B>Refresh</B> it in
the usual way. Keep the default parameters for <B>fmin</B>, <B>fmax</B>,
<B>Voices</B>, <B>Mirror</B>, <B>Size</B> and <B>Type</B> of the analyzing
wavelet. Hit <B>Compute WT</B>. The wavelet transform <EM>cwt_Wei00</EM>
should appear in the <B>Input CWT</B> box. Uncheck the box <B>Single
Time Exponent</B>, so that it becomes <B>Hölder Function</B>. Leave the
other parameters unchanged and hit <B>Compute</B>. After a short while,
you'll get a new signal <EM>GWei0_Ht0</EM>, that contains the estimated
pointwise exponent.  <B>View</B> this signal. As you'll see, this is
very far from being the expected y=x line. In order to understand why
we are so much off, we shall now try and estimate the exponent at a
single point. In that view, click on <B>Hölder Function</B> which now
turns to <B>Single Time Exponent</B>. In the <B>Time instant</B> box,
enter, e.g., 300. Leave the other parameters unchanged, and hit
<B>Compute</B>. A graphic window appears: On its left part you can see
the points in the scale/space plane that were selected as local
maxima.  On the right part is displayed a log-log plot of the
magnitude of the wavelet coefficients at these points with respect to
scale. The slope, currently indicated by the red line, is supposed to
give the Hölder exponent. With the cross that appears when you point
to this window, select a regression range (by default, this is the
whole available range). Selecting the range between points 4 and 7,
you'll get an estimated exponent of around 18. Between points 2 and 4,
you'll get something like -1. As a matter of fact, you can obtain
almost any exponent by clicking in an adequate region. The problem here
is that the exponent is governed by the extremal values of the wavelet
coefficients. A robust method should then compute the regression only
considering those extremal values. Unfortunately, it is not easy to
detect which values are indeed extremal. 
<P>Once you're finished with testing various regression ranges, hit
<B>return</B> on your keyboard and close this window. We shall now try
the GIFS based estimation. In the <B>Variables</B> list of the main
window, select <EM>GWei0</EM>, and go to <B>1D Exponents
Estimation</B>/<B>Pointwise Holder Exponent</B>/<B>GIFS based estimation</B>.
Verify that the <B>Input</B> is what you want, and hit <B>Compute</B> with
the default parameters. The estimation, called <EM>alphagifs_GWei00</EM>,
quickly appears in the <B>Variables</B> list. On viewing it, you'll see
that the general trend is what we were expecting, with a number of
small oscillations around it. The slope is somewhat smaller than 1,
but we do get the impression of a signal with steadily increasing
regularity.
<P>Our third method is the oscillation based one. Again, select
<EM>GWei0</EM> in the <B>Variables</B> list, and go to <B>1D Exponents
Estimation</B>/<B>Pointwise Holder Exponent</B>/<B>oscillation based
method</B>. Check your <B>Input data</B>, and hit <B>Compute</B> with the
default parameters. You get the estimation in the signal called
<EM>pht_GWei00</EM>: We obtain again a roughly correct general trend, with
more oscillations than in the GIFS based estimation, but with a better
slope (you can verify this by viewing both <EM>pht_GWei00</EM> and
<EM>alphagifs_GWei00</EM> on the same graph, using the <B>hold</B> facility
in the <B>View</B> menu). You can reduce a bit the oscillations by
choosing <B>Nmin</B>= 4 and <B>Nmax</B>= 64
<P>In the fourth experiment, we shall compute the local exponent: select
<EM>GWei0</EM> in the <B>Variables</B> list, and go to <B>1D Exponents
Estimation</B>/<B>Local Holder Exponent</B>/<B>oscillation based method</B>.
Check your <B>Input data</B>. Hit <B>Compute</B> with the default
parameters. The output is called <EM>pht_GWei01</EM>. The same remark as
above applies, i.e. we get a lot of oscillations with a roughly
correct slope. Again, you can minimize the oscillations by choosing
<B>Nmin</B>= 4 and <B>Nmax</B>= 64. It is interesting to check that the
local estimation is, at (almost...) all points, a lower bound to the
pointwise one, as predicted by the theory.
<P>Finally, we'll see what happens when using a more advanced method based
on 2-microlocal analysis. Select <EM>GWei0</EM> in the <B>Variables</B>
list, and go to <B>1D Exponents Estimation</B>/<B>2-microlocal
Exponent</B>/<B>Oscillation based (1)</B>. In the window that appears, hit
<B>Refresh</B> so that the <B>name</B> of the Input data becomes
<EM>GWei0</EM>. Choose a <B>window</B> size of 100 instead of the default
1024. Since the computations are a bit long with this method, we'll
perform the estimation only every tenth point. Thus, we set the
<B>step</B> parameter to 10. Finally, click on <B>frontier</B> and select
<B>local</B> instead. Hit <B>Compute</B>. You will probably wait for less
than a couple of minutes until the outputs, called <EM>lenlocd_GWei00</EM>
and <EM>Gloc_GWei00</EM> appear. The estimated local exponent is
<EM>Gloc_GWei00</EM> and this is the one we shall view. As above, we get a
curve that increases in the mean between 0 and 0.8, although this time
there is a larger number of points where the local exponent is grossly
underestimated. We shall also estimate the pointwise exponent with
this method: click again on <B>local</B> and this time select
<B>pointwise</B> instead. Hit <B>Compute</B>. View the output called
<EM>Gpt_GWei00</EM>. This estimate is a little bit better that the local
one, with fewer underestimated values. Recall however that, in both
cases here, the fact that we estimate only every tenth exponent make
the underestimated areas look more important. If you are very patient,
you may check this by launching the estimation with a <B>step</B> of 1
instead of 10.
