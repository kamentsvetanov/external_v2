<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Pointwise Hölder Exponent</A></H2>

<P>Many techniques have been developed to estimate pointwise (and local)
Hölder exponents, none of which give satisfactory results in all
cases. Estimating a local irregularity index on discrete data without
any a priori assumption is indeed a difficult task. One way to obtain
robust results is to use a parametric approach. Such estimators have
been developed mainly in the case of fractional Brownian motion and
its extensions, such as multifractional Brownian motion. One such
method is implemented in <B>Fraclab</B>. Non parametric methods, which
are more numerous, generally give the correct estimation only when
some technical conditions are met. <B>Fraclab</B> currently includes
three such estimators, which are, in order of increasing quality : a
standard method based on the continuous wavelet transform, with
various improvements ; a second one relying on the use of generalized
iterated functions systems. And a third one based on the evaluation of
the oscillations. Note finally that more robust estimates of both the
pointwise and local exponents, which work under broader assumptions,
are available when one computes the 2-microlocal exponents. See the
help corresponding to this topic below.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Parametric estimation of the exponent of an fBm or an mBm.</A>
</H2>

<P>For an fBm or an mBm with smooth H(t), the local and pointwise
exponent are the same. The parametric estimator implemented here is
based on (4), and is proved to converge almost surely as soon as one
is dealing with a discrete trace of an fBm or mBm.
<P>As in most processing tools of <B>Fraclab</B>, the first line of the
sub-menu window, entitled <B>Input Signal</B>, should display the signal
currently analyzed.  A known bug here is that the current signal of
the <B>Variables</B> list sometimes does not appear by default. When
this occurs, or if you wish to switch to another signal by
highlighting another selection in the Variables list, press
<B>Refresh</B>. There is only parameter that needs to be chosen before
you launch the estimation, which is the <B>window size</B>. The
<B>optimal</B> choice, as the name indicate, is the theoretical best
size, i.e. the size which minimizes the risk. As is often the case in
such situations, visually more pleasing results are obtained by using
a slightly larger size, typically by multiplying the optimal size by a
logarithmic factor: choosing <B>enlarged</B> just does this. In many
situations, you'll find that it gives a clearer picture of the
meaningful variations of H, because the variance has been decreased
(at the expense of course of an increase in bias). When you suspect
that your analyzed signal is an fBm, i.e. the exponent is the same all
along the path, a more judicious choice is to use the whole signal as
a window. This is the third choice, <B>constant H</B>. Once you have
decided a window size, press <B>Compute</B> as usual. The output signal,
denoted <EM>estim_Hölder_func_sig#</EM> (where sig is your input signal), is a
1D vector which gives the exponent at each point. The two other
buttons are the customary <B>Help</B> and <B>Close</B> buttons. Note
finally that computing times can get very large if your input signal
has more than 1024 points.
<P>A known bug in this sub-menu is that border effects have not been
satisfactorily taken into account. As a result, the estimates on the
first points are sometimes weird (e.g. you get a plateau which has no
real meaning).

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 CWT-based estimation</A>
</H2>

<P>The Continuous-Wavelet-Transform-based non parametric estimator of the
Hölder function is probably the most well known method for estimating
exponents, although it is not the most precise one. It is based on a
remarkable property of wavelet coefficients: They are bounded from
above by a quantity that depends on scale and on the Hölder
exponent. Since this bound is optimal, it can serve as a basis for an
estimation method. However, the bound is practical only of one assumes
that the relevant coefficients for estimating the exponent at point t
are located "nearly above" t. This is equivalent to assuming that the
pointwise and local exponents coincide. This condition is hard to
verify in practice, and somewhat restrictive.
<P>When you launch this method, you get a window entitled "Local Hölder
Exponent Estimation" (recall that this will also be the pointwise one
if the procedure is applicable). In this simple form, you need just
decide at which point you want to compute the exponent, by entering a
value in the <B>Estimation time</B> box (the default is 1, which is a
bit unfortunate, since the first point will always suffer from border
effects). On hitting <B>Compute</B>, the value of the estimated exponent
will appear in the <B>Local Scaling Exponent</B> box. If you need more
control on the computations, hit <B>Advanced compute</B>. A new window
appears, entitled <B>Hölder Function or Local Exponent</B>. Check first
in the <B>Input Signal</B> box that you are dealing with the desired
signal, otherwise <B>Refresh</B> it in the usual way. You will then
specify various parameters related to the wavelet transform: <B>fmin</B>
and <B>fmax</B> let you choose the minimum and maximum frequencies of
analysis. The default values are the ones yielding maximal span
compatible with the size of the signal. You may change the extreme
frequencies either by typing values under <B>fmin</B> and <B>fmax</B>, or
by using the predefined values on the menus to the right. The
<B>Voices</B> parameters governs the number of intermediate frequencies
between <B>fmin</B> and <B>fmax</B> at which the continuous wavelet
coefficients will be computed. Be warned that giving an excessive
number of voices may result in large computing times for long
signals. Checking the <B>Mirror</B> item will deal the border effects by
mirroring the signal at its extremities. Otherwise, zero-padding is
used. Finally, you may choose the <B>Size</B> and <B>Type</B> of your
analyzing wavelet: available wavelets are the <B>Mexican Hat</B>, and
the real and analytic <B>Morlet</B> wavelet. The size may be any
positive number (this parameter is not available for the Mexican
hat). Once all the parameters that define the wavelet transform are
chosen, hit <B>Compute WT</B>. The output signal is a matrix of size
"number of voices" x "size of the original signal".  It is called
<EM>cwt_signal#</EM>, if "signal" is the name of your data, and where # is as
usual an incremental parameter. It should appear in the <B>Input CWT</B>
box just below the <B>Compute WT</B> button. You may want to view the
continuous wavelet transform using the <B>View</B> menu. Note that
<B>Fraclab</B> recognizes wavelet transforms, and display them
differently form regular images. In particular, it uses a fixed aspect
ratio (this is useful for instance if the number of voices is much
smaller than the size of the signal), and the "jet" color-map, which
often allows to highlight the important structures. If you want to
view the transform as a normal image, or make other changes in the
appearance, use the functionalities of the <B>View</B> menu described in
the <B>Overview</B> help file.
<P>The <B>Refresh</B> button to the left of the <B>Input CWT</B> box lets you
load a wavelet transform which would already be present in the
<B>Variables</B> list of the main window. This avoids computing several
times the same transform. Once you are happy with your transform, move
to the lower part of the window, which performs the actual computation
of the exponents. Decide first if you wish to compute a <B>Single
Time Exponent</B> (default), otherwise uncheck this box, and it will
become <B>Hölder Function</B>. In the first case, you need to give the
<B>Time Instant</B> at which the exponent will be estimated (with again
the unfortunate default "1"). In the second case, this choice becomes
unavailable, because you will compute the exponent at each point. In
fact, this last statement is not quite true: Because the CWT-based
estimator is a bit slow, it has been arbitrarily decided that only one
point every four points would actually be processed. This is why the
output signal is four times smaller than the input one. This fact may
seem somewhat strange, because it means that the results of this menu
cannot really be used in actual applications you may have. However,
our justification is that the CWT-based estimation does not usually
give good results. This window is thus mainly included because
wavelet-based estimators are widely used, and for comparison
purposes. Some of the reasons why the method often fails are explained
at the end of this paragraph. 
<P>Recall that the exponent is obtained thanks to the fact that the
coefficients are bounded from above by a certain quantity. As a
consequence, in many cases, more relevant estimates are obtained if
one chooses, at each scale, the largest coefficient among the ones
which are located "nearly above" the current point t. This is the
default in <B>Fraclab</B>, as is indicated by the fact that the
<B>Local Maxima</B> box is checked. If you unmark this box by pressing
the button to the left of <B>Yes</B> (which subsequently becomes
<B>No</B>), then the program will use the coefficients which are in the
column <EM>strictly</EM> above t. In case you want to use the local
maxima, you need to tell <B>Fraclab</B> where to look for the largest
coefficient. In other words, you must define precisely what is meant
by "the coefficients located <EM>nearly</EM> above the point t". This is
the purpose of the <B>Radius</B> and <B>Scale Depth</B> parameters. The
default values of respectively 8 and 1 mean that, starting from the point
t, the program will look for the largest coefficients at the scale
immediately above (this is the "1"), and in a spatial neighbourhood of
size 8. These two parameters are available for both the estimation at
a single point and at all points. To the contrary, the <B>Specify
Regression Range</B> choice is only meaningful for a single time
exponent. When <B>Specify Regression Range</B> is chosen, you will be
able to decide which range of frequencies is to be used for the
estimation of the exponent (we explain how at the end of this
paragraph). Otherwise, when <B>Full Range Regression</B> is
selected, the estimation is performed using all coefficients between
<B>fmin</B> and <B>fmax</B>. The exponents will be obtained through
a regression of the logarithm of the wavelet coefficients modulus with
respect to scale, and you may choose the type of regression: The default
is <B>Least Square Regression</B>. Other choices are <B>Weighted Least
Square</B>, <B>Penalized Least Square</B>, <B>Maximum Likelihood</B> and
<B>Lepskii Adaptive Procedure</B>. Only the last one is not well
known. See (6) for details.
<P>When you hit <B>Compute</B>, three things may happen: if <B>Hölder
Function</B> was checked, the program will output a signal called
em/signal_Ht#/, with the usual naming conventions.  If <B>Single Time
Exponent</B> was checked instead, with the option <B>Full Range
Regression</B>, the program will display a graphic window showing in
abscissa the log-scale, and in ordinate the log of the modulus of the
coefficients. This display helps to check if the regression is
meaningful, i.e. if the points on this graph are well aligned. In that
view, the regression line is displayed in red. In parallel, you get
the value of the estimated exponent in the box <B>Local Scaling
Exponent</B>. If <B>Specify Regression Range</B> was checked instead of
<B>Full Range Regression</B>, you also get a graphic window, but this
time you have additional information and control: to the left of this
window, you see the part of the wavelet transform which lies in the
neighbourhood of the selected time instant. Note that a grey levels
color-map is used. You will also see two red curves, which show the
region in which local maxima are searched for when this option is
activated. Finally, you should see, at each scale, i.e. on each line
of the wavelet transform, a circle which indicates which coefficient
was chosen at this particular scale. If no local maxima were used,
this circles will lie exactly above t, while otherwise they might be
distributed anywhere between the two red curves. The graph to the
right of the window is the same as in the previous case, i.e. it shows
in abscissa the log-scale, and in ordinate the log of the modulus of
the coefficients. Now <B>Specify Regression Range</B> means that, using
the large cross that appears when you point to this window, you will
be able to select a range of frequencies between which the regression
will be performed. Of course, you want to choose a region where the
points are reasonably well aligned. Sometimes there is no such
region. In other cases, there might be two or more sub-parts in the
graph where linear behaviours are observed. Since we are interested
here in local exponents, you should in general prefer to choose the
region containing the highest frequencies. To actually select the
region, click first on the left end of the chosen interval, then click
again on its right end, or vice-versa. Each time you have selected a
frequency range, <B>Fraclab</B> will compute an estimated exponent and
show its value in the caption above the graph to the right of the
window. In addition, the regression line will be displayed in red. If
you want to test another region, just click again its endpoints. Once
you are satisfied with a result, hit <B>Enter</B> on your keyboard, and
the cross will disappear. The exponent will then appear in the
<B>Hölder Function or Local Exponent</B> window in front of <B>Local
Scaling Exponent</B>. You may now close the graphic window showing the
evolution of the wavelet coefficients.
<P>To understand some of the reasons why the method is not so good, try
it on a deterministic Weierstrass function synthesized with the
defaults options. Launch the <B>Advance compute</B> procedure, and use
again the defaults, except that you estimate at the middle point of
your signal, i.e. at abscissa 128. Observe how the log-log plot
display oscillations: By choosing a regression range on various parts
of the frequency interval, you will be able to get essentially any
exponent you want, including negative ones.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 GIFS-based estimation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This method is applicable only when the pointwise and local exponents
coincide. In contrast with the CWT-based one, it is very fast. The
principle is the following: The extension of IFS called GIFS allows
to construct signals which are able to approximate (in L2 and
L-infinity norms) any L2 signal with arbitrary precision. GIFS are
just IFS where the number of maps and the various parameters are
allowed to change at each scale (see (2) for details). The first step
in this estimation method is to compute a GIFS which approximates at
best the original signal. In that view, one starts by computing the
discrete wavelet transform of the signal. The parameters of the GIFS
are then simply obtained as ratios of the wavelet coefficients. Once
the GIFS is known, the estimation of the exponent is easy, because
there is an analytical formula which gives the exponent at each point
of a GIFS as a function of its parameters. Because the formula in only
valid in the limit of infinite resolution, the obtained result is of
course a finite size approximation.
<P>From a practical point of view, you start as usual by checking and
maybe updating the <B>Input</B> signal. You then choose which
approximation procedure you want to use, i.e. the <B>Limit type</B> in a
choice of <B>regression</B> and <B>Cesaro</B> (choosing one or the other
option will in general hardly affect the result). Finally, you may
choose which <B>Wavelet</B> to use, although in the current
implementation of <B>Fraclab</B> only Daubechies 4 is available. On
pressing <B>Compute</B>, you get an output signal, named
<EM>alphagifs_signal#</EM>, which contains the estimated Hölder function. Note
that this program assumes that the input data contains 2^N
points. If this is not the case, only the first 2^N points will
processed, where N is the largest integer such that the 2^N does not
exceed the actual number of points in the signal. The remaining points
will simply be ignored.
<P>Test this method on a deterministic Weierstrass function synthesized with the
defaults options.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Oscillation-based estimation</A>
</H2>

<P>In contrast with previous ones, this method does not assumes that the
local and pointwise exponents coincide. It truly tries to estimate the
pointwise one. The principle is very simple: it just uses the
definition of the exponent as a measure of how the oscillation of the
signal in a neighbourhood of a given point t behaves with respect to
the size of the neighbourhood. As usual, you first check the <B>Input
data name</B> box and <B>Refresh</B> it if needed. You then need to choose
what are the minimal and maximal sizes of the neighbourhood that will
be used to investigate the behaviour of the oscillations. Enter the
appropriate values in the <B>Nmin</B> and <B>Nmax</B> boxes, either
directly or using the menus. Any integer will do, as long as Nmin is
smaller than Nmax and Nmax is compatible with the size of the
signal. These values should be understood as follows: Nmax = 8, for
instance, means that the largest neighbourhood will be composed of 8
points to each side of the point where one wishes to perform the
estimation. In other words, the neighbourhood will be a window of size
17 sample points centered at the point of interest. Increasing the
values of both Nmin and Nmax yields smoother estimates, at the expense
of precision. A value of Nmin larger than 1 roughly means that a high
frequency cut-off is in effect. Larger values of Nmax let you include
more low frequency information in the estimation.
<P>Finally, you may choose a <B>Regression Type</B> from the usual choice
of <B>Least Square Regression</B>, <B>Weighted Least Square</B>,
<B>Penalized Least Square</B>, <B>Maximum Likelihood</B> and <B>Lepskii
Adaptive Procedure</B> (see reference (6)). On hitting <B>Compute</B>, you
get the output <EM>data pht_signal#</EM>, which contains the estimated
exponent at each point. Note that refinements of this oscillation
based method exist. They use a Bayesian framework that allows to
minimize the effect of discretization. We hope to include these
extensions in a future release of <B>Fraclab</B>.
