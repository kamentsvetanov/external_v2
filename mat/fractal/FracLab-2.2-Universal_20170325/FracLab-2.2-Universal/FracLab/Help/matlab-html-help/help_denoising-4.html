<H2><A NAME="s4">4. The <B>Multifractal Regularization (L2 norm)</B> sub-menu</A></H2>

<P>
<P>The framework is now that of regularization, i.e. we make no
assumption whatsoever about a possible noise. We just seek a signal Z,
which is close in the L2 sense to the observations Y (your input signal), and with
regularity equal to that of Y plus a shift. Just specify your
<B>Analyzed signal</B>, and the desired <B>Hölder exponent shift</B>. Then
hit <B>Compute</B> to get the regularized signal, called <EM>mreg_signal#</EM>.
Typical values for the shift in this case are again around 2.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="s5">5. The <B>Multifractal Regularization (pseudo Kullback norm)</B></A></H2>
<P>
<P>This is exactly the same as above, except this time we minimize the
distance between Z and Y using the Kullback norm (or something close
to it). The regularized signal is called <EM>mreglog_signal#</EM>. The
advantages of this distance are that the computations are much simpler
(the numerical minimization is replaced by an analytical one), and that
it allows for further generalizations. For instance, the forthcoming
version of <B>Fraclab</B> will include a multiplicative transform of the
exponents instead of a shift, in the case where this distance is use.
Typical values for the shift in this case are around 1.
