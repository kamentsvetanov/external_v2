	<p>
	Fraclab is a general purpose signal and image processing toolbox
	based on fractal and multifractal methods.
	Fraclab can be approached from two different perspectives :
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Fractal analysis :</li>
		A large number of procedures allow to compute various fractal
		quantities associated with 1D or 2D signals, such as
		dimensions, Hölder exponents or multifractal spectra.
	<li>Signal processing :</li>
		Alternatively, one can use Fraclab directly to perform many 
		basic tasks in signal processing, including estimation,
		detection, denoising, modelling, segmentation,classification,
		and synthesis.
	</ul>
	<p>
	Note that Fraclab is not intended to process "fractal" signals 
	(whatever meaning is given to this word), but rather to apply 
	fractal tools to the study of irregular but otherwise arbitrary signals.
	A graphical interface makes Fraclab easy to use and intuitive.
	In addition, various wavelet-related tools are available in Fraclab.
