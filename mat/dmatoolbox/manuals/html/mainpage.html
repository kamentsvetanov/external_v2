         <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>DMAT is short for the Diffusion Model Analysis Toolbox. It is a MATLAB&#8482; toolbox for fitting the Ratcliff Diffusion Model to
            reaction time and accuracy data. For a summary of what this means, we refer the user to several papers by Roger Ratcliff,
            in particular Ratcliff (1978, Psychological Review, 85, pp.59-108) and Ratcliff and Tuerlinckx (2002, Psychonomic Bulletin
            &amp; Review, 9, pp.438-481).
         </p>
         <p>A DMAT Primer is to appear in <i>Behavior Research Methods</i> in 2007:

with MATLAB: a DMAT primer. _Behavior Research Methods._
</pre><h2>Requirements<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>To succesfully run DMAT, you need MATLAB version R2006a or better, with the Optimization Toolbox and the Statistics Toolbox
            installed. The Symbolic toolbox is nice to have, but DMAT will run without it. Beside that, all you need as much RAM and CPU
            speed as you can get, and perhaps a healthy dose of patience and a sense of humor.
         </p>
         <p>For MATLAB itself, see system requirements at <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/r2006a/">http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/r2006a/</a>.
         </p>
         <h2>Mailing list<a name="5"></a></h2>
         <p>The DMAT mailing list will be used to send information about updates and bug fixes, and optionally to handle 'customer service'
            (although we do not guarantee such service). We hope, however, that the mailing list may also grow into a forum where researchers
            who deal with diffusion modeling can get in touch with one another easily. We may at some point decide to split this subject
            away from the list for DMAT users, but for now we use only one list.
         </p>
         <p>To subscribe to the mailing list, simply send an e-mail with only the words <tt>"subscribe dmatoolbox"</tt> (in the mail body, without quotation marks) to <a href="mailto:listserv@listserv.cc.kuleuven.be">listserv@listserv.cc.kuleuven.be</a>. You will receive a confirmation mail shortly afterward.

         <h2>License summary<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>The Diffusion Model Analysis Toolbox (DMAT) is offered free of charge to anyone interested in using diffusion models, provided
            that you properly cite it (see below), and that it is not used for financial profit. Requests to use DMAT for any commercial
            purpose must be directed to the authors. DMAT comes without any warranty of any kind.

Annex A :
Description of the Software

The Diffusion Model Analysis Toolbox (DMAT) is a 
collection of MATLAB files that implement an algorithm 
for quickly and efficiently estimating the parameters 
of the Ratcliff Diffusion Model. Details of the model 
and the algorithm are provided in Vandekerckhove and 
Tuerlinckx (2007). DMAT also contains extra tools, such 
as a graphical user interface (GUI), a rescue tool, 
documentation, demonstrations, and more.
