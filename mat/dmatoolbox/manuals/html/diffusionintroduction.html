         <h2>Background<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>In many settings in experimental psychology, researchers collect more than one type of data. In fact, as the complexity of
            psychological theories grows, the number of dependent variables in experiments is bound to increase, and the information contained
            in the interrelations between these dependents becomes more interesting. Advances in psychological statistics, psychometrics
            and mathematical psychology should (and do) reflect this change in the type of data we are prone to encounter. However, standard
            analyses for multivariate data are hitherto only available for some rather specific situations (e.g., when all the dependents
            can be assumed to be normally distributed, multivariate linear models can be applied, etc.).
         </p>
         <p>A somewhat common situation where these latter conditions do not apply, however, is the combination of reaction time and accuracy
            data (a ubiquitous combination often referred to as two-choice response time data). Tasks put to participants in psychological
            experiments often combine these two variables, one of which is binary (the accuracy), while the other is strictly positive
            and strongly right-skewed. Thus, both are decidedly non-normally distributed and classical linear models are hence unsuitable.
         </p>
         <p>For the analysis of two-choice response time data, several nonlinear stochastic models have been developed, often with substantive
            interpretations attached to them (e.g., the discrete random walk model; Laming, 1968; Link &amp; Heath, 1975). A more advanced
            model &#8211; and the one that is at the heart of the present article &#8211; was first proposed in 1978 (the Ratcliff diffusion model;
            Ratcliff, 1978, 1981, 1985, 1987, 1988). The latter model, which will be described in detail in the next section, has performed
            remarkably well in the analysis of two-choice response time data. It has successfully been applied to experiments in many
            different fields, such as memory (Ratcliff, 1978, 1988), letter-matching (Ratcliff, 1981), lexical decision (Ratcliff, Gomez,
            &amp; McKoon, 2004), signal detection (Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998; Ratcliff, Thapar, &amp; McKoon, 2001; Ratcliff, Van Zandt, &amp; McKoon,
            1999), visual search (Strayer &amp; Kramer, 1994), and perceptual judgment (Ratcliff, 2002; Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 2000; Thapar, Ratcliff,
            &amp; McKoon, 2003).
         </p>
         <h2>The diffusion process<a name="4"></a></h2>
         <p>The diffusion process has been used to describe and model the decision component in simple two-choice tasks. In the model,
            it is assumed that an observer has a unidimensional internal representation of evidence, where the two choices reside at the
            extremes. When the observer is presented with a stimulus, information regarding it is accumulated sequentially over time and
            the amount of evidence changes. This feature is shared with other sequential sampling models such as the discrete random walk
            model (Laming, 1968; Link &amp; Heath, 1975), the accumulator model (Smith &amp; Vickers, 1988; Vickers, 1970), and the Poisson counter
            model (LaBerge, 1994; Pike, 1966, 1973; Townsend &amp; Ashby, 1983). The evidence is accumulated towards one or the other response
            criterion until the total exceeds one of the criteria. These two criteria are called absorbing boundaries, each of which is
            associated with one response. The decision time is defined as the time from the start of the process until the moment one
            of the absorbing boundaries is reached.
         </p>
         <h2>Boundary separation<a name="5"></a></h2>
         <p>Thus, a first parameter of the Ratcliff diffusion model is the boundary separation, denoted by <i>a</i>. If this boundary separation is small, the process is expected to end sooner but it is more prone to error since random variability
            inherent to the decision process may cause it to end up at the wrong boundary. When the boundaries are separated further from
            each other, both accuracy and expected reaction time will increase. The distance between the two absorbing boundaries therefore
            regulates the relation between speed and accuracy (the so-called speed-accuracy trade-off).
         </p>
         <h2>Starting point<a name="6"></a></h2>
         <p>The information accumulation process itself has three other important characteristics. First, the point at which the accumulation
            process starts is called the starting point, which is denoted as <i>z0</i> here. The starting point may be located closer to one of the boundaries than to the other but it always lies between them
            (0 &lt; <i>z0</i> &lt; <i>a</i>). This parameter introduces the possibility of response bias in the decision process because the process is more likely to
            end at the boundary closer to the starting point.
         </p>
         <h2>Between-trial variability in starting point<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>Instead of considering the starting point fixed, we will assume it to vary from trial to trial according to a uniform distribution,
            with mean <i>z</i> (0 &lt; <i>z0</i> &lt; <i>a</i>) and range <i>sz</i> (o &lt; <i>sz</i> &lt; min(<i>z</i>, <i>a-z</i>). The choice for a uniform distribution is obvious in this case because the starting point has to be restricted to lie between
            the two absorbing boundaries. In our case, the end points of the uniform distribution can be set so that z0 can never exceed
            either of the absorbing boundaries. This would not be posssible with, for example, the Gaussian distribution.
         </p>
         <h2>Drift rate<a name="8"></a></h2>
         <p>A second feature is that the information accumulation process, depending on the stimulus presented, can have a tendency to
            drift off to one of the two absorbing boundaries. This tendency is called the drift rate, denoted by <i>xi</i>. The drift rate is determined by the quality of the stimulus. A non-ambiguous stimulus leads to a large positive drift rate
            such that the process has a high probability of hitting the upper boundary (indicating a correct response) in a short time.
            However, for a highly ambiguous stimulus, the drift rate will be close to zero so that there is an almost 50% chance to end
            up at either of the two boundaries. Moreover, the decision process takes longer when the drift rate is close to zero (because
            then there is no outspoken tendency to drift off to either boundary).
         </p>
         <h2>Within-trial variability in drift rate<a name="9"></a></h2>
         <p>A third feature of the diffusion process is that the information accumulation process is stochastic, implying that there is
            some uncertainty in the outcome and time course of the decision process. The drift rate <i>v</i>  quantifies only the mean rate of information accumulation but the actual drift is subject to variability and this amount
            of variability is captured by the parameter <i>s</i>, representing the volatility of the accumulation process. This standard deviation is a non-identified parameter in the model
            because it is involved in a trade-off relation with the other parameters of the model. This means that the model does not
            change (i.e., the same predictions for reaction times and choice probabilities follow) if all parameters are multiplied by
            the same constant. Therefore, we must fix s to an arbitrary value, which will be 0.1 in this case because that corresponds
            to a consensus value in the literature (e.g. Ratcliff et al., 1999; Tuerlinckx, 2004). The variability of the information
            accumulation process within a trial implies that the precise course of the decision trajectory is unpredictable. Due to the
            inherently stochastic nature of the model, different decision processes can evolve differently, even if they are governed
            by the same set of parameter values. A consequence of this is that both the time to decide and the final choice are random
            variables.
         </p>
         <h2>Between-trial variability in drift rate<a name="10"></a></h2>
         <p>Besides the deviations of the information accumulation process from the drift rate within a trial, it is also quite unlikely
            that the invoked drift rate <i>xi</i> will be the same every time a similar stimulus is presented to a person. There are two reasons that force us to reject that
            possibility. First, stimuli may be formally the same but they will be seldom exactly the same on all possible dimensions.
            Such variation will lead to different drift rates <i>xi</i>. An example is a pixel discrimination experiment where the ratio of black to white pixels may be the same for a class of
            stimuli, but the exact configuration of black and white pixels differs over these stimuli with the same ratio. Secondly, even
            it were possible to present exactly the same stimulus to a person twice, the perceived quality of the stimulus will differ
            on both occasions due to (internal and external) perceptual noise. For these reasons we will allow the drift rate to differ
            from trial to trial, despite the fact that the same stimulus may be presented to the person. The variability in the drift
            rate over trials is represented by a Gaussian distribution with mean <i>v</i> and standard deviation <i>eta</i>. In sum, this means that the actual rate of information accumulation is subject to two sources of variability: First, a single
            trial's drift rate is a draw from a normal distribution and, second, the rate of accumulation may fluctuate, within a trial,
            about the mean drift rate because of the assumed variability in the accumulation process.
         </p>
         <p>There are many conceptual reasons for assuming variability in the starting point and drift rate (i.e., quantities showing
            variability over trials render a-priori a more realistic model), but there are also important empirical arguments for taking
            into account these sources of variability. In many experiments the error reaction times can be systematically shorter than
            their correct counterparts for some conditions. Such phenomena could be modeled by assuming variability in the starting point.
            Error reaction times that turn out to be systematically longer than correct ones can be modeled by assuming variability in
            the mean drift rate. If both sources of variability are present in the model, even more complicated crossover patterns in
            the data (errors faster than corrects in some conditions but the reverse for others) can be explained (for a more detailed
            discussion on these topics, see Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998, and Ratcliff et al., 1999). Moreover, without the variability in
            drift rate the probability of a correct response would approach to one, and that is a highly unrealistic prediction, because
            even in the easiest conditions of an experiment, a small percentage of errors (lapses) is almost always observed.
         </p>
         <h2>Nondecision time<a name="12"></a></h2>
         <p>Another component of the model we will be using in this paper represents that part of the observed reaction time that did
            not originate from the diffusion process (termed the residual time or non-decision time). It is the time needed to perform
            non-decision processes such as encoding of the stimulus, response preparation and execution of the motor response (Luce, 1986).
            We denote the non-decision part of the observed reaction time as <i>ter</i>.
         </p>
         <h2>Between-trial variability in nondecision time<a name="13"></a></h2>
         <p>Most likely, the component times of <i>ter</i> will vary from trial to trial, so we assume that <i>ter</i> also varies randomly from trial to trial. To capture this variability in <i>ter</i>, we have chosen to work with the uniform distribution because of its simple form and parameters that are easy to interpret.
            The mean of the distribution equals <i>Ter</i> (the mean time devoted to the processes other than deciding) and its range is <i>st</i>, so that the uniform density function ranges from <i>Ter</i> - <i>st</i> to <i>Ter</i> + <i>st</i>. The density at any point within the boundaries is constant and equal to 1 / <i>st</i> .

%% An introduction to the diffusion model
%% Background
% In many settings in experimental psychology, researchers collect more
% than one type of data. In fact, as the complexity of psychological
% theories grows, the number of dependent variables in experiments is bound
% to increase, and the information contained in the interrelations between
% these dependents becomes more interesting. Advances in psychological
% statistics, psychometrics and mathematical psychology should (and do)
% reflect this change in the type of data we are prone to encounter.
% However, standard analyses for multivariate data are hitherto only
% available for some rather specific situations (e.g., when all the
% dependents can be assumed to be normally distributed, multivariate linear
% models can be applied, etc.).
%%
% A somewhat common situation where these latter conditions do not apply,
% however, is the combination of reaction time and accuracy data (a
% ubiquitous combination often referred to as two-choice response time
% data). Tasks put to participants in psychological experiments often
% combine these two variables, one of which is binary (the accuracy), while
% the other is strictly positive and strongly right-skewed. Thus, both are
% decidedly non-normally distributed and classical linear models are hence
% unsuitable.
%%
% For the analysis of two-choice response time data, several nonlinear
% stochastic models have been developed, often with substantive
% interpretations attached to them (e.g., the discrete random walk model;
% Laming, 1968; Link & Heath, 1975). A more advanced model – and the one
% that is at the heart of the present article – was first proposed in 1978
% (the Ratcliff diffusion model; Ratcliff, 1978, 1981, 1985, 1987, 1988).
% The latter model, which will be described in detail in the next section,
% has performed remarkably well in the analysis of two-choice response time
% data. It has successfully been applied to experiments in many different
% fields, such as memory (Ratcliff, 1978, 1988), letter-matching (Ratcliff,
% 1981), lexical decision (Ratcliff, Gomez, & McKoon, 2004), signal
% detection (Ratcliff & Rouder, 1998; Ratcliff, Thapar, & McKoon, 2001;
% Ratcliff, Van Zandt, & McKoon, 1999), visual search (Strayer & Kramer,
% 1994), and perceptual judgment (Ratcliff, 2002; Ratcliff & Rouder, 2000;
% Thapar, Ratcliff, & McKoon, 2003).

%% The diffusion process
% The diffusion process has been used to describe and model
% the decision component in simple two-choice tasks. In the model, it is
% assumed that an observer has a unidimensional internal representation of
% evidence, where the two choices reside at the extremes. When the observer
% is presented with a stimulus, information regarding it is accumulated
% sequentially over time and the amount of evidence changes. This feature
% is shared with other sequential sampling models such as the discrete
% random walk model (Laming, 1968; Link & Heath, 1975), the accumulator
% model (Smith & Vickers, 1988; Vickers, 1970), and the Poisson counter
% model (LaBerge, 1994; Pike, 1966, 1973; Townsend & Ashby, 1983). The
% evidence is accumulated towards one or the other response criterion until
% the total exceeds one of the criteria. These two criteria are called
% absorbing boundaries, each of which is associated with one response. The
% decision time is defined as the time from the start of the process until
% the moment one of the absorbing boundaries is reached.
%% Boundary separation
% Thus, a first parameter of the Ratcliff diffusion model is the boundary
% separation, denoted by _a_. If this boundary separation is small, the
% process is expected to end sooner but it is more prone to error since
% random variability inherent to the decision process may cause it to end
% up at the wrong boundary. When the boundaries are separated further from
% each other, both accuracy and expected reaction time will increase. The
% distance between the two absorbing boundaries therefore regulates the
% relation between speed and accuracy (the so-called speed-accuracy
% trade-off).
%% Starting point
% The information accumulation process itself has three other important
% characteristics. First, the point at which the accumulation process
% starts is called the starting point, which is denoted as _z0_ here. The
% starting point may be located closer to one of the boundaries than to the
% other but it always lies between them (0 < _z0_ < _a_). This parameter
% introduces the possibility of response bias in the decision process
% because the process is more likely to end at the boundary closer to the
% starting point. 
%% Between-trial variability in starting point
% Instead of considering the starting point fixed, we will assume it to
% vary from trial to trial according to a uniform distribution, with mean
% _z_ (0 < _z0_ < _a_) and range _sz_ (o < _sz_ < min(_z_, _a-z_). The
% choice for a uniform distribution is obvious in
% this case because the starting point has to be restricted to lie between
% the two absorbing boundaries. In our case, the end points of the uniform
% distribution can be set so that z0 can never exceed either of the
% absorbing boundaries. This would not be posssible with, for example, the
% Gaussian distribution.
%% Drift rate
% A second feature is that the information accumulation process, depending
% on the stimulus presented, can have a tendency to drift off to one of the
% two absorbing boundaries. This tendency is called the drift rate, denoted
% by _xi_. The drift rate is determined by the quality of the stimulus. A
% non-ambiguous stimulus leads to a large positive drift rate such that the
% process has a high probability of hitting the upper boundary (indicating
% a correct response) in a short time. However, for a highly ambiguous
% stimulus, the drift rate will be close to zero so that there is an almost
% 50% chance to end up at either of the two boundaries. Moreover, the
% decision process takes longer when the drift rate is close to zero
% (because then there is no outspoken tendency to drift off to either
% boundary).
%% Within-trial variability in drift rate
% A third feature of the diffusion process is that the information
% accumulation process is stochastic, implying that there is some
% uncertainty in the outcome and time course of the decision process. The
% drift rate _v_  quantifies only the mean rate of information accumulation
% but the actual drift is subject to variability and this amount of
% variability is captured by the parameter _s_, representing the volatility
% of the accumulation process. This standard deviation is a non-identified
% parameter in the model because it is involved in a trade-off relation
% with the other parameters of the model. This means that the model does
% not change (i.e., the same predictions for reaction times and choice
% probabilities follow) if all parameters are multiplied by the same
% constant. Therefore, we must fix s to an arbitrary value, which will be
% 0.1 in this case because that corresponds to a consensus value in the
% literature (e.g. Ratcliff et al., 1999; Tuerlinckx, 2004). The
% variability of the information accumulation process within a trial
% implies that the precise course of the decision trajectory is
% unpredictable. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of the model,
% different decision processes can evolve differently, even if they are
% governed by the same set of parameter values. A consequence of this is
% that both the time to decide and the final choice are random variables.
%% Between-trial variability in drift rate
% Besides the deviations of the information accumulation process from the
% drift rate within a trial, it is also quite unlikely that the invoked
% drift rate _xi_ will be the same every time a similar stimulus is presented
% to a person. There are two reasons that force us to reject that
% possibility. First, stimuli may be formally the same but they will be
% seldom exactly the same on all possible dimensions. Such variation will
% lead to different drift rates _xi_. An example is a pixel discrimination
% experiment where the ratio of black to white pixels may be the same for a
% class of stimuli, but the exact configuration of black and white pixels
% differs over these stimuli with the same ratio. Secondly, even it were
% possible to present exactly the same stimulus to a person twice, the
% perceived quality of the stimulus will differ on both occasions due to
% (internal and external) perceptual noise. For these reasons we will allow
% the drift rate to differ from trial to trial, despite the fact that the
% same stimulus may be presented to the person. The variability in the
% drift rate over trials is represented by a Gaussian distribution with
% mean _v_ and standard deviation _eta_. In sum, this means that the actual rate
% of information accumulation is subject to two sources of variability:
% First, a single trial's drift rate is a draw from a normal distribution
% and, second, the rate of accumulation may fluctuate, within a trial,
% about the mean drift rate because of the assumed variability in the
% accumulation process.
%% 
% There are many conceptual reasons for assuming variability in the
% starting point and drift rate (i.e., quantities showing variability over
% trials render a-priori a more realistic model), but there are also
% important empirical arguments for taking into account these sources of
% variability. In many experiments the error reaction times can be
% systematically shorter than their correct counterparts for some
% conditions. Such phenomena could be modeled by assuming variability in
% the starting point. Error reaction times that turn out to be
% systematically longer than correct ones can be modeled by assuming
% variability in the mean drift rate. If both sources of variability are
% present in the model, even more complicated crossover patterns in the
% data (errors faster than corrects in some conditions but the reverse for
% others) can be explained (for a more detailed discussion on these topics,
% see Ratcliff & Rouder, 1998, and Ratcliff et al., 1999). Moreover,
% without the variability in drift rate the probability of a correct
% response would approach to one, and that is a highly unrealistic
% prediction, because even in the easiest conditions of an experiment, a
% small percentage of errors (lapses) is almost always observed.
%% Nondecision time
% Another component of the model we will be using in this paper represents
% that part of the observed reaction time that did not originate from the
% diffusion process (termed the residual time or non-decision time). It is
% the time needed to perform non-decision processes such as encoding of the
% stimulus, response preparation and execution of the motor response (Luce,
% 1986). We denote the non-decision part of the observed reaction time as
% _ter_.
%% Between-trial variability in nondecision time
% Most likely, the component times of _ter_ will vary from trial to
% trial, so we assume that _ter_ also varies randomly from trial to trial.
% To capture this variability in _ter_, we have chosen to work with the
% uniform distribution because of its simple form and parameters that are
% easy to interpret. The mean of the distribution equals _Ter_ (the mean
% time devoted to the processes other than deciding) and its range is _st_,
% so that the uniform density function ranges from _Ter_ - _st_ to _Ter_ +
% _st_. The density at any point within the boundaries is constant and
% equal to 1 / _st_ .
