         <h2>Try to define models such that all parameters have similar ranges<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>MATLAB's optimizers use the same step size and sensitivity for each parameter. That means that they are most effective if
            all parameters are on the same scale. In DMAT, the standard parameters have a range somewhere between 0 and 1. So, if you
            define designs, try to make sure that reasonable parameter estimates are also in that range.
         </p>
         <p>For example, if you define a design matrix on the basis of a covariate, like this:</p><pre>&gt;&gt; E = 0:20:100</pre><pre class="codeoutput">E =
     0    20    40    60    80   100
</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; designmatrix = [ones(length(E),1) E']</pre><pre class="codeoutput">designmatrix =
     1     0
     1    20
     1    40
     1    60
     1    80
     1   100
</pre><p>You should rescale it, such that most of the values are in the range 0-1, or maybe even lower (like 0-.5):</p><pre>&gt;&gt; E = E./max(E(:))</pre><pre class="codeoutput">E =
         0    0.2000    0.4000    0.6000    0.8000    1.0000
</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; designmatrix = [ones(length(E),1) E']</pre><pre class="codeoutput">designmatrix =
    1.0000         0
    1.0000    0.2000
    1.0000    0.4000
    1.0000    0.6000
    1.0000    0.8000
    1.0000    1.0000
</pre><h2>Try different starting points<a name="8"></a></h2>
         <p>In particular if you have more complicated designs, the EZDIFF starting point may not be ideal (though it usually is very
            good). Restarting the optimization procedure with a different initial guess might yield better results.

%% DMAT: Tips and tricks
% This is a list of running tips and cunning tricks that might help you get
% the most out of our software. Use them wisely, and they may serve you
% well.
%% Try to define models such that all parameters have similar ranges
% MATLAB's optimizers use the same step size and sensitivity for each
% parameter. That means that they are most effective if all parameters are
% on the same scale. In DMAT, the standard parameters have a range
% somewhere between 0 and 1. So, if you define designs, try to make sure
% that reasonable parameter estimates are also in that range.
%%
% For example, if you define a design matrix on the basis of a covariate,
% like this:
%%
%  >> E = 0:20:100
E = 0:20:100
%%
%  >> designmatrix = [ones(length(E),1) E']
designmatrix = [ones(length(E),1) E']
%%
% You should rescale it, such that most of the values are in the range 0-1,
% or maybe even lower (like 0-.5):
%%
%  >> E = E./max(E(:))
E = E./max(E(:))
%%
%  >> designmatrix = [ones(length(E),1) E']
designmatrix = [ones(length(E),1) E']
%% Try different starting points
% In particular if you have more complicated designs, the EZDIFF starting
% point may not be ideal (though it usually is very good). Restarting the
% optimization procedure with a different initial guess might yield better
% results.
