         <introduction>
            <p>In order to reach a wide public, and because not everyone is accustomed to working with a command interface like MATLAB's,
               we have provided a graphical user interface with the Diffusion Model Analysis Toolbox. However, we would like to stress from
               the start that the command interface has more options and more flexibility than the GUI. Some things you just won't be able

         <p>When MATLAB is loaded, simply type: <tt>dmatgui</tt>. A window will pop up that should look very much like this:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_01.png"> <p>We've tried to make this GUI work as intuitively as possible.</p>
         <h2>GUI structure<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>In the GUI, there are five main panels. On the right side, there is the <b>Data set panel</b>, which contains a view of the data once you've loaded them, and a Browse button and filename field. This panel also contains
            buttons that let you switch to the Output Viewer (more about this later) and allow you to save or load a DMAT session (so
            you can stop working and continue later).
         </p>
         <p>On the left side, there are four panels. The <b>Change settings</b> panel gives access to model properties that you can edit in order to construct a diffusion model for your experiment.
         </p>
         <p>The <b>Current settings</b> panel displays some information about the model that is currently loaded (i.e., the one you're working on).
         </p>
         <p>The <b>Queue actions</b> panel gives access to queues of models. In general, you will want to evaluate not one model, but an entire series of models.
            Such series of models are called 'queues'. With the buttons in this panel, you can save, load, edit and build queues. You
            can also submit them for evaluation with the Run button.
         </p>
         <p>Last is the <b>Tools</b> panel, where you can access some programs that do not directly relate to Diffusion Model Analysis.
         </p>
         <h2>Loading data<a name="8"></a></h2>
         <p>Before you can do anything in the DMAT GUI, you will need to load a data set. There are two ways of loading data into the
            GUI. The easier way is to click the <tt>Browse</tt> button and locate the file on your hard drive. Another way is to simply type the filename and location into the Datafile
            field and click anywhere in the GUI. If there is something wrong with the datafile, the data set will be rejected and an error
            message will tell you why.
         </p>
         <p>After loading, the data should be shown in the table, as seen here:</p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_02.png"> <p>Notice that we've loaded a very large data set now, and that the entire set is not displayed (to conserve Java memory), but
            DMAT informs (at the bottom left) that it has in fact been loaded.
         </p>
         <h2>Descriptive statistics<a name="11"></a></h2>
         <p>As soon as a data set has been loaded, DMAT can calculate some simple descriptive statistics for you. Simply click <tt>Switch to output viewer</tt>, and the following window will appear:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_03.png"> <p>This list contains some simple statistics, such as accuracy ratings, average response times, and break-downs by condition
            and reply. Selecting <tt>Histogram plots</tt> from the list on the left will show the distribution of response time for each response and each condition (use the little
            listbox at the bottom to switch between conditions):
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_04.png"> <p>The buttons in this window have the following functions. <tt>Main Window</tt> closes the output viewer and returns to the main window. <tt>Text Mode</tt> hides the GUI and gives the user command-prompt control. <tt>Save</tt> can be used to save the output (if there is anything to save). <tt>Load</tt> can be used to load a previously saved DMAT output. <tt>Export</tt> responds differently according to what you're viewing. If the output viewer is currently showing a figure, it will cause
            a new window to pop up with the image (or several windows if there was more than one image) in them, so you can edit them
            with MATLAB Plot Tools if you like. If the output viewer is showing a table, <tt>Export</tt> will write that table and all other available ones to an Excel file (on Windows; note that this can take a while). Finally,
            the rightmost button, labeled simply <tt>!</tt> is a panic button, which resets the Output Viewer to its virgin state. It's there just in case something goes wrong and the
            Output Viewer doesn't respond properly.
         </p>
         <h2>Defining models #1<a name="14"></a></h2>
         <p>With the DMAT GUI, there are two basic ways of defining a model. One straightforward way is to browse through the Change settings
            panel in the main window and construct exactly the model you like. You can select an outlier treatment strategy (the default
            is <tt>none</tt>), define design matrices for any or all parameters (the default is <tt>no effects across conditions</tt> for all parameters), fix certain parameters (default is none), or set specific biases (i.e., starting point <i>z0</i> as a certain fraction of boundary separation <i>a</i> (default is none).
         </p>
         <p>To change <b>design matrices</b>, for example for drift rate <i>v</i>, select <i>v</i> in the menu. This screen will appear:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_05.png"> <p>The <tt>Specific Help</tt> button here only tells you one thing: when inputting a table or matrix in MATLAB, you need to confirm each entry by selecting
            another field:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_06.png"> <p>This hint applies to all other tables as well.</p>
         <p>Now, input the design matrix of your liking, or remove every entry to remove any design (i.e., allow each drift rate to vary
            freely across conditions), like so:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_07.png"> <p>And confirm by clicking <tt>OK</tt>. Notice that, in the main window, the <tt>Current settings</tt> panel no longer shows that a design on <i>v</i> is implemented:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_08.png"> <p>To change <b>specific biases</b>, click the button labeled <tt>Set B</tt> (where B refers to the fraction that links <i>z0</i> to <i>a</i>, so that <i>a</i> = <i>z0</i> * B). This window appears:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_09.png"> <p>Often, B will be approximately equal to .5. We could eliminate a parameter from the model by applying this restriction to
            all conditions, like so:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_10.png"> <p>Again, confirm with <tt>OK</tt> to store these restrictions.
         </p>
         <p><b>Important:</b> DMAT employs a strict hierarchy concerning the application of restrictions. The hierarchy is (1) design matrices, (2) fixed
            parameters, (3) specific biases. In practice, this means that if you have entered a design matrix for a specific parameter
            <i>and</i> fixed some of these parameters to a certain value, the fixes will be ignored and only the design matrix will be used. Similarly,
            in our example, we have input specific biases (namely <i>z0</i> = .5 * <i>a</i>), but there is still a default design matrix present, and if DMAT runs this model, that design matrix will override the specific
            biases. Thus, in order to apply the spcific biases, you will need to select <i>z0</i> from the design matrices list and remove every entry there, just as shown above for drift rate. Then and only then will the
            specific biases have any effect. If you've removed the design on <i>z0</i>, the <tt>Current settings</tt> panel should look like this:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_11.png"> <p><b>Advanced settings</b> are available with the <tt>Advanced</tt> button. Clicking that will cause this window to appear:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_12.png"> <p>Here, you can input bootstrap requests, or change the way the objective function is calculated or minimized. You can also
            make the DMAT GUI prettier.
         </p>
         <p>When you've finished defining a model, you can add it to the Model Queue by clicking the <tt>Current model</tt> button under <tt>Queue actions</tt>. The GUI will ask you to name the model:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_13.png"> <p>... and will then add the model to its queue of models. You can view (and edit) the queue with the <tt>View</tt> button:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_14.png"> <h2>Defining models #2<a name="28"></a></h2>
         <p>Defining models like this can be cumborsome. A short-cut exists, however, behind the <tt>Predefined</tt> button in the <tt>Queue actions</tt> panel. Clicking this button will bring up a list of elementary models:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_15.png"> <p>For this data set, we may choose to load two standard models: the <tt>No effects</tt> model and the <tt>Effect on nu only</tt> model. The first model is of course also the default, but the second allows for free estimation of different drift rates.
            In fact, all models provided in this list are equipped with all the standard settings from <tt>multiestv4</tt>, save for different design matrices. Selecting both and clicking <tt>Add</tt> will cause DMAT to add them to the queue directly. Click <tt>View</tt> again to see:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_16.png"> <p>In general, it is a good idea to allow DMAT to fit simpler models first, and more complex ones after that. Using the <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> buttons, you can change the order of models in the queue:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_17.png"> <p>You can also delete, copy or edit models in this queue. Note: when you click <tt>Edit</tt>, the model you selected will be removed from the queue for editing. If you don't put it back in place it (by clicking <tt>Current model</tt>) afterwards, it will not be included in the queue.
         </p>
         <h2>Running queues<a name="32"></a></h2>
         <p>'Running' a queue means fitting each of the models in it, one by one. When you've loaded your data and defined all the models
            you like, click <tt>Run</tt> to start estimating parameters. The output viewer will pop up immediately. After some time (patience may be needed), the
            output viewer will start to show results of model fits that have been completed. When the queue is finished, the list on the
            upper left will contain all the models in the queue, and more output options will have appeared in the menu below that:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_18.png"> <p>While DMAT is performing parameter estimation in the background (progress is shown in the MATLAB Command Window), you can
            use the output viewer to inspect the descriptive statistics it has compiled. When each model is finished, the output viewer
            will be updated with more output, and you can start viewing this as well. However, we would generally recommend not bothering
            your computer at all while DMAT is running.
         </p>
         <p>The viewer gives several types of output. If you're interested in recovery of the model (i.e., how closely the model approximates
            the data, the <tt>Chi-by-eye</tt> output should be interesting. It shows the empirical cumulative RT distributions for X=0 and X=1 responses in a full blue
            line. Then, the theoretical reproductions are overlaid in green and red dashed lines. Ideally, the lines overlap perfectly,
            as in the example (which had, for this very reason, very many data points):
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_19.png"> <p>For an example of poorly fitting CDFs, switch to the output of the first model:</p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_20.png"> <p>Another popular visual representation is the quantile probability plot. A good fit is indicated by full lines (the model)
            connecting the crosses (data), like this:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_21.png"> <p>Poor fit would be indicated by large misses of these lines. Note that rendering a QPP is a computationally heavy task, so
            it may take a few moments to appear (and perhaps more than a few moments if there are many conditions).
         </p>
         <p>Of more interest if you are comparing conditions are the standard errors of the parameter point estimations:</p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_22.png"> <p>It should be mentioned, however, that this output can also tell something about model fit. In the case of poor model fit (and
            in particular if the model is misspecified, the fitting algorithm did not converge, there are too few data points, or the
            data is too noisy), some of these standard errors might be imaginary numbers, represented in <tt>a+bi</tt> format, like <tt>0.0000+0.0345i</tt>. If <i>one</i> of the standard errors in this table has an imaginary component, each element will be displayed in <tt>a+bi</tt> format (so standard errors that are in fact strictly real might be displayed as <tt>0.0049+0.0000i</tt>).
         </p>
         <p>Further, for comparing parameters across conditions, you can choose to plot the point estimates of each parameter across conditions.
            In the same plot, error bars of a single standard error will be shown (unless at least one of the standard errors is imaginary,
            in which case red circles will be displayed).
         </p>
         <h2>Saving and loading<a name="41"></a></h2>
         <p>If you have to interrupt your work, or would like to continue what you're doing at a later time, you can save DMAT sessions,
            output files, or model queues. An entire DMAT session can be saved and loaded from the button on the right side of the main
            window. Sessions are saved in a MATLAB file, but their extension is .dms, so it's easier to keep track of them. If you load
            a previous session, your current session will be lost.
         </p>
         <p>DMAT queues can be saved or loaded with the Save and Load buttons in the <tt>Queue actions</tt> panel. Notice that, just like with sessions, DMAT queues can be saved in a MATLAB file with its own extension (.dmq). However,
            it is also possible to save queues as MATLAB m-files. This will produce a script that you can execute later, and which will
            perform the model evaluations for the models and data that you've defined without needing to load the graphical user interface.
            DMAT can also read and interpret those m-file scripts (if they are unchanged in structure), so you can load a queue from an
            m-file. If you load a queue, your current queue will be lost.
         </p>
         <p>Finally, DMAT output can be saved with the <tt>Save</tt> button on the Output viewer, or loaded with the <tt>Load</tt> button. If you do this, just like when you load a session, your previous session will be overwritten and lost. Notice that
            you can only load output from the output viewer, and that you have to load a (any) data set before you can access that window.
         </p>
         <h2>Crashes<a name="44"></a></h2>
         <p>In the case of a crash (of DMAT, MATLAB, or your operating system), DMAT makes emergency back-ups. In fact, even while it
            is running, back-ups are constantly made and updated. In the event of a crash, you can access these back-ups and convert them
            to normal save files (as explained above) with the Rescue Tool, which you can call with the <tt>Rescue</tt> button in the main window:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_23.png"> <h2>Simulating<a name="45"></a></h2>
         <p>Lastly, the DMAT GUI also contains a simulation tool, which you activate with the <tt>Simulator</tt> button. This window will appear:
         </p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dmatmanualgui_24.png"> <p>Here, you can input diffusion model parameters for as many conditions as you like, and specify how many data points there
            should be in each condition. Clicking <tt>Simulate and save</tt> will cause a browser window to pop up where you can select a file name and location for the data file. Simulating data is
            relatively efficient, but for very large data sets (more than 100,000 data points), it may take a while. It is not possible
            to simulate contaminated data sets with this tool.

%% The DMAT GUI
% In order to reach a wide public, and because not everyone is accustomed
% to working with a command interface like MATLAB's, we have provided a
% graphical user interface with the Diffusion Model Analysis Toolbox.
% However, we would like to stress from the start that the command
% interface has more options and more flexibility than the GUI. Some things
% you just won't be able to do with just the GUI (but all the basics, you
% will).
%%
% When MATLAB is loaded, simply type: |dmatgui|. A window will pop up that
% should look very much like this:
imshow('mainwindow1.png')
%%
% We've tried to make this GUI work as intuitively as possible.
%% GUI structure
% In the GUI, there are five main panels. On the right side, there is the
% *Data set panel*, which contains a view of the data once you've loaded
% them, and a Browse button and filename field. This panel also contains
% buttons that let you switch to the Output Viewer (more about this later)
% and allow you to save or load a DMAT session (so you can stop working and
% continue later).
%%
% On the left side, there are four panels. The *Change settings* panel
% gives access to model properties that you can edit in order to construct
% a diffusion model for your experiment.
%%
% The *Current settings* panel displays some information about the model
% that is currently loaded (i.e., the one you're working on).
%%
% The *Queue actions* panel gives access to queues of models. In general,
% you will want to evaluate not one model, but an entire series of models.
% Such series of models are called 'queues'. With the buttons in this
% panel, you can save, load, edit and build queues. You can also submit
% them for evaluation with the Run button.
%%
% Last is the *Tools* panel, where you can access some programs that do not
% directly relate to Diffusion Model Analysis.
%% Loading data
% Before you can do anything in the DMAT GUI, you will need to load a data
% set. There are two ways of loading data into the GUI. The easier way is
% to click the |Browse| button and locate the file on your hard drive.
% Another way is to simply type the filename and location into the Datafile
% field and click anywhere in the GUI. If there is something wrong with the
% datafile, the data set will be rejected and an error message will tell
% you why.
%%
% After loading, the data should be shown in the table, as seen here:
imshow('mainwindow2.png')
%%
% Notice that we've loaded a very large data set now, and that the entire
% set is not displayed (to conserve Java memory), but DMAT informs (at the
% bottom left) that it has in fact been loaded.
%% Descriptive statistics
% As soon as a data set has been loaded, DMAT can calculate some simple
% descriptive statistics for you. Simply click |Switch to output viewer|,
% and the following window will appear:
imshow('output_descriptives1.png')
%%
% This list contains some simple statistics, such as accuracy ratings,
% average response times, and break-downs by condition and reply. Selecting
% |Histogram plots| from the list on the left will show the distribution of
% response time for each response and each condition (use the little
% listbox at the bottom to switch between conditions):
imshow('output_histograms1.png')
%%
% The buttons in this window have the following functions. |Main Window|
% closes the output viewer and returns to the main window. |Text Mode|
% hides the GUI and gives the user command-prompt control. |Save| can be
% used to save the output (if there is anything to save). |Load| can be
% used to load a previously saved DMAT output. |Export| responds
% differently according to what you're viewing. If the output viewer is
% currently showing a figure, it will cause a new window to pop up with the
% image (or several windows if there was more than one image) in them, so
% you can edit them with MATLAB Plot Tools if you like. If the output
% viewer is showing a table, |Export| will write that table and all other
% available ones to an Excel file (on Windows; note that this can take a
% while). Finally, the rightmost button, labeled simply |!| is a panic
% button, which resets the Output Viewer to its virgin state. It's there
% just in case something goes wrong and the Output Viewer doesn't respond
% properly.
%% Defining models #1
% With the DMAT GUI, there are two basic ways of defining a model. One
% straightforward way is to browse through the Change settings panel in the
% main window and construct exactly the model you like. You can select an
% outlier treatment strategy (the default is |none|), define design
% matrices for any or all parameters (the default is |no effects across
% conditions| for all parameters), fix certain parameters (default is
% none), or set specific biases (i.e., starting point _z0_ as a certain
% fraction of boundary separation _a_ (default is none).
%%
% To change *design matrices*, for example for drift rate _v_, select _v_
% in the menu. This screen will appear:
imshow('designmatrix1.png')
%%
% The |Specific Help| button here only tells you one thing: when inputting
% a table or matrix in MATLAB, you need to confirm each entry by selecting
% another field:
imshow('designmatrixhint.png')
%%
% This hint applies to all other tables as well.
%%
% Now, input the design matrix of your liking, or remove every entry to
% remove any design (i.e., allow each drift rate to vary freely across
% conditions), like so:
imshow('designmatrix2.png')
%%
% And confirm by clicking |OK|. Notice that, in the main window, the
% |Current settings| panel no longer shows that a design on _v_ is
% implemented:
imshow('mainwindow3.png')
%%
% To change *specific biases*, click the button labeled |Set B| (where B
% refers to the fraction that links _z0_ to _a_, so that _a_ = _z0_ * B).
% This window appears:
imshow('biases1.png')
%%
% Often, B will be approximately equal to .5. We could eliminate a
% parameter from the model by applying this restriction to all conditions,
% like so:
imshow('biases2.png')
%%
% Again, confirm with |OK| to store these restrictions.
%%
% *Important:* DMAT employs a strict hierarchy concerning the application
% of restrictions. The hierarchy is (1) design matrices, (2) fixed
% parameters, (3) specific biases. In practice, this means that if you have
% entered a design matrix for a specific parameter _and_ fixed some of
% these parameters to a certain value, the fixes will be ignored and only
% the design matrix will be used. Similarly, in our example, we have input 
% specific biases (namely _z0_ = .5 * _a_), but there is still a default
% design matrix present, and if DMAT runs this model, that design matrix
% will override the specific biases. Thus, in order to apply the spcific
% biases, you will need to select _z0_ from the design matrices list and
% remove every entry there, just as shown above for drift rate. Then and
% only then will the specific biases have any effect. If you've removed the
% design on _z0_, the |Current settings| panel should look like this:
imshow('mainwindow4.png')
%%
% *Advanced settings* are available with the |Advanced| button. Clicking
% that will cause this window to appear:
imshow('advanced1.png')
%%
% Here, you can input bootstrap requests, or change the way the objective
% function is calculated or minimized. You can also make the DMAT GUI
% prettier.
%%
% When you've finished defining a model, you can add it to the Model Queue
% by clicking the |Current model| button under |Queue actions|. The GUI
% will ask you to name the model:
imshow('inputname.png')
%%
% ... and will then add the model to its queue of models. You can view (and
% edit) the queue with the |View| button:
imshow('queue1.png')
%% Defining models #2
% Defining models like this can be cumborsome. A short-cut exists, however,
% behind the |Predefined| button in the |Queue actions| panel. Clicking
% this button will bring up a list of elementary models:
imshow('addpre1.png')
%%
% For this data set, we may choose to load two standard models: the |No
% effects| model and the |Effect on nu only| model. The first model is of
% course also the default, but the second allows for free estimation of
% different drift rates. In fact, all models provided in this list are
% equipped with all the standard settings from |multiestv4|, save for 
% different design matrices. Selecting both and clicking |Add| will cause
% DMAT to add them to the queue directly. Click |View| again to see: 
imshow('queue2.png')
%%
% In general, it is a good idea to allow DMAT to fit simpler models first,
% and more complex ones after that. Using the |+| and |-| buttons, you can
% change the order of models in the queue:
imshow('queue3.png')
%%
% You can also delete, copy or edit models in this queue. Note: when you
% click |Edit|, the model you selected will be removed from the queue for
% editing. If you don't put it back in place it (by clicking |Current
% model|) afterwards, it will not be included in the queue.
%% Running queues
% 'Running' a queue means fitting each of the models in it, one by one.
% When you've loaded your data and defined all the models you like, click
% |Run| to start estimating parameters. The output viewer will pop up
% immediately. After some time (patience may be needed), the output viewer
% will start to show results of model fits that have been completed. When
% the queue is finished, the list on the upper left will contain all the
% models in the queue, and more output options will have appeared in the
% menu below that:
imshow('output_parest1.png')
%%
% While DMAT is performing parameter estimation in the background (progress
% is shown in the MATLAB Command Window), you can use the output viewer to
% inspect the descriptive statistics it has compiled. When each model is
% finished, the output viewer will be updated with more output, and you can
% start viewing this as well. However, we would generally recommend not
% bothering your computer at all while DMAT is running.
%%
% The viewer gives several types of output. If you're interested in
% recovery of the model (i.e., how closely the model approximates the data,
% the |Chi-by-eye| output should be interesting. It shows the empirical
% cumulative RT distributions for X=0 and X=1 responses in a full blue
% line. Then, the theoretical reproductions are overlaid in green and red
% dashed lines. Ideally, the lines overlap perfectly, as in the example
% (which had, for this very reason, very many data points):
imshow('output_chibyeye1.png')
%%
% For an example of poorly fitting CDFs, switch to the output of the first
% model:
imshow('output_chibyeye2.png')
%%
% Another popular visual representation is the quantile probability plot. A
% good fit is indicated by full lines (the model) connecting the crosses
% (data), like this:
imshow('output_qpp1.png')
%%
% Poor fit would be indicated by large misses of these lines. Note that
% rendering a QPP is a computationally heavy task, so it may take a few
% moments to appear (and perhaps more than a few moments if there are many
% conditions).
%%
% Of more interest if you are comparing conditions are the standard errors
% of the parameter point estimations:
imshow('output_stderr1.png')
%%
% It should be mentioned, however, that this output can also tell something
% about model fit. In the case of poor model fit (and in particular if the
% model is misspecified, the fitting algorithm did not converge, there are
% too few data points, or the data is too noisy), some of these standard
% errors might be imaginary numbers, represented in |a+bi| format, like
% |0.0000+0.0345i|. If _one_ of the standard errors in this table has an
% imaginary component, each element will be displayed in |a+bi| format (so
% standard errors that are in fact strictly real might be displayed as
% |0.0049+0.0000i|).
%%
% Further, for comparing parameters across conditions, you can choose to
% plot the point estimates of each parameter across conditions. In the same
% plot, error bars of a single standard error will be shown (unless at
% least one of the standard errors is imaginary, in which case red circles
% will be displayed).
%% Saving and loading
% If you have to interrupt your work, or would like to continue what you're
% doing at a later time, you can save DMAT sessions, output files, or model
% queues. An entire DMAT session can be saved and loaded from the button on
% the right side of the main window. Sessions are saved in a MATLAB file,
% but their extension is .dms, so it's easier to keep track of them. If you
% load a previous session, your current session will be lost.
%%
% DMAT queues can be saved or loaded with the Save and Load buttons in the
% |Queue actions| panel. Notice that, just like with sessions, DMAT queues
% can be saved in a MATLAB file with its own extension (.dmq). However, it
% is also possible to save queues as MATLAB m-files. This will produce a
% script that you can execute later, and which will perform the model
% evaluations for the models and data that you've defined without needing
% to load the graphical user interface. DMAT can also read and interpret
% those m-file scripts (if they are unchanged in structure), so you can
% load a queue from an m-file. If you load a queue, your current queue will
% be lost.
%%
% Finally, DMAT output can be saved with the |Save| button on the Output
% viewer, or loaded with the |Load| button. If you do this, just like when
% you load a session, your previous session will be overwritten and lost.
% Notice that you can only load output from the output viewer, and that you
% have to load a (any) data set before you can access that window.
%% Crashes
% In the case of a crash (of DMAT, MATLAB, or your operating system), DMAT
% makes emergency back-ups. In fact, even while it is running, back-ups are
% constantly made and updated. In the event of a crash, you can access
% these back-ups and convert them to normal save files (as explained above)
% with the Rescue Tool, which you can call with the |Rescue| button in the
% main window:
imshow('rescue.png')
%% Simulating
% Lastly, the DMAT GUI also contains a simulation tool, which you activate
% with the |Simulator| button. This window will appear:
imshow('tools.png')
%%
% Here, you can input diffusion model parameters for as many conditions as
% you like, and specify how many data points there should be in each
% condition. Clicking |Simulate and save| will cause a browser window to
% pop up where you can select a file name and location for the data file.
% Simulating data is relatively efficient, but for very large data sets
% (more than 100,000 data points), it may take a while. It is not possible
% to simulate contaminated data sets with this tool.
