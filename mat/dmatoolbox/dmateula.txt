Annex A :
Description of the Software

The Diffusion Model Analysis Toolbox (DMAT) is a collection of MATLAB files that implement an algorithm for quickly and efficiently estimating the parameters of the Ratcliff Diffusion Model. Details of the model and the algorithm are provided in Vandekerckhove and Tuerlinckx (2006). DMAT also contains extra tools, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), a rescue tool, documentation, demonstrations and more.
