function cdfdif(varargin)
% CDFDIF  Calculates the conditional CDF of the Ratcliff diffusion model.
%   CDF = CDFDIF(RTS,REPLY,PARAM), where PARAM is a parameter vector
%   with the following 7 elements:
%      (1) boundary separation (a)
%      (2) mean of the rectangular nondecision time distribution (Ter)
%      (3) standard deviation of the gaussian drift rate distribution (eta)
%      (4) mean of the rectangular starting point distribution (z)
%      (5) range of the rectangular starting point distribution (sz)
%      (6) range of the rectangular nondecision time distribution (st)
%      (7) mean of the gaussian drift rate distribution (v)
%   The other input variables are REPLY (should be 0 or 1, indicating the
%   response given) and RTS (a vector with response times). CDF will then
%   contain the conditional cumulative density for each reaction time.
%
%   Note: CDFDIF always returns a row vector with size(RTS,2) elements, and
%   it evaluates the CDF of the values in RTS one by one, in their linear
%   order, even if the input was a matrix and not a vector! This means that
%   if RTS = [a b;c d;e f], the output will be [CDF(a) CDF(c)]. It's easier
%   if you just use vectors.
%
%   [CDF P1]= CDFDIF(RTS,REPLY,PARAM) will also return P1, which is the
%   marginal probability of a "1" response (so NOT the marginal probability
%   of the response in REPLY!).

%   CDFDIF is a MEX-file that is generated and compiled by the function
%   SETNODES. You cannot edit it in M-code, and it is not recommended to
%   edit SETNODES, as this may corrupt the functionality of the DMA
%   Toolbox. If you think your CDFDIF file is corrupted, compiled binaries
%   or a clean version of SETNODES can be recovered from the installation
%   package at the DMAT website.
%
%   Note that the binaries that are included in the package are generated
%   with the help of the Symbolic Math Toolbox and are superior to ones
%   that are generated by SETNODES on a machine that doesn't have this
%   Toolbox.
