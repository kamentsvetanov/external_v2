-- Versioning --
This repo contains the latest version of git.m.
Whenever there is a stable release, the submission on MATLAB Central's File Exchange will be periodically synched from the latest stable release here.

-- OS, Distributions --
This version was developed on OS X, but is expected to work on POSIX-compliant systems like OS X, BSD, and GNU/Linux.
Windows is a different beast, and it should work as well anecdotally, but your mileage may vary.
