% For comparison purposes, we call GLMdenoise again but turn off the global
% noise regressors.  This is done by simply setting the maximum number of PCs
% to 0.  Outputs from this call will be stored in 'resultsALT' and 'denoiseddataALT',
% and a separate set of figures will be written to 'example1figuresALT'.
% We will inspect the results of this GLMdenoise call at a later point.
[resultsALT,denoiseddataALT] = GLMdenoisedata(design,data,stimdur,tr,[],[],struct('numpcstotry',0),'example1figuresALT');

%% Inspect figures

% GLMdenoisedata writes out a number of figures illustrating the various 
% computations that are performed.  It is useful to browse through these
% figures to check sanity.  Here we highlight the most useful figures, 
% but there are additional figures (all figures are described in the 
% documentation in GLMdenoisedata.m.).

% 'MeanVolume.png' shows the mean across all volumes.
% This is useful as a frame of reference.
figure;
imagesc(imread('example1figures/MeanVolume.png'),[0 255]);
colormap(gray);
axis equal tight off;
title('Mean volume');
%%

% 'FinalModel.png' shows the R^2 of the final model fit.  The color range is
% 0% to 100% (but is nonlinear; see the color bar).  These R^2 values are not 
% cross-validated (thus, even voxels with no signal have positive R^2 values).
figure;
imagesc(imread('example1figures/FinalModel.png'),[0 255]);
colormap(hot);
axis equal tight off;
cb = colorbar;
set(cb,'YTick',linspace(0,255,11),'YTickLabel',round((0:.1:1).^2 * 100));
title('Final model R^2 (not cross-validated)');
%%

% 'NoisePool.png' shows which voxels were used for the noise pool.  Assuming
% the default parameters, the noise pool consists of voxels whose (1) mean 
% intensity is greater than one-half of the 99th percentile of mean intensity
% values and (2) cross-validated R^2 value is less than 0%.  Notice that
% the noise pool omits voxels near the top of the slice because the raw
% signal level is relatively low there (due to the distance from the RF coil).
figure;
imagesc(imread('example1figures/NoisePool.png'),[0 255]);
colormap(gray);
axis equal tight off;
title('Noise pool');
%%

% 'HRF.png' shows the initial HRF guess (red) and the final HRF estimate (blue).
% Full flexibility is given to the HRF estimate, so the noisiness of the HRF 
% estimate gives an indication of the SNR level in the data.  In this case,
% the HRF estimate looks very nice, suggesting that the data have good SNR.
% The first point in the HRF coincides with the onset of a condition (which is
% denoted by 1s in the design matrix).  The granularity of the HRF reflects
% the sampling rate (TR) of the data.
figure;
imageactual('example1figures/HRF.png');
%%

% 'PCcrossvalidationXX.png' shows cross-validated R^2 values corresponding
% to different numbers of PCs.  The color range is 0% to 100%.  Here we show 
% the initial model (no PCs) and the final model (number of PCs selected by
% the code).  Notice that because of cross-validation, most voxels are black,
% indicating cross-validated R^2 values that are 0% or less.  Also, notice
% that there is some gain in cross-validation performance in the middle of the 
% slices.  The most effective way to view and interpret these figures 
% is to flip between them in quick succession, and this is easiest to do 
% in your operating system (not in MATLAB).

set(gcf,'Units','points','Position',[100 100 900 325]);

title(sprintf('Final model (PC = %d) cross-validated R^2',results.pcnum));
%%

% 'PCscatterXX.png' shows scatter plots of the cross-validation performance of the 
% initial model (no PCs) against the performance of individual models with
% different numbers of PCs.  Here we show the scatter plot corresponding to
% the final model (number of PCs selected by the code).  Voxels that were
% used to determine the optimal number of PCs are shown in red; other voxels 
% are shown in green.  This figure shows that adding PCs produces a clear and
% consistent improvement in cross-validation performance.
figure;
imageactual(sprintf('example1figures/PCscatter%02d.png',results.pcnum));
%%

% 'PCselection.png' illustrates how the number of PCs was selected.  The median
% cross-validated R^2 value across a subset of the voxels (marked as red
% in the scatter plots) is plotted as a line, and the selected number
% of PCs is marked with a circle.  Assuming the default parameters,
% the code chooses the minimum number of PCs such that the improvement 
% relative to the initial model is within 5% of the maximum improvement.
% This is a slightly conservative selection strategy, designed to avoid
% overfitting and to be robust across different datasets.

imageactual('example1figures/PCselection.png');

%% Inspect outputs

% The outputs of GLMdenoisedata are contained in 
% the variables 'results' and 'denoiseddata'.
% Here we do some basic inspections of the outputs.

% Select a voxel to inspect.  This is done by finding voxels that have 
% cross-validated R^2 values between 0% and 5% under the initial model (no PCs),
% and then selecting the voxel that shows the largest improvement when
% using the final model.
ix = find(results.pcR2(:,:,:,1) > 0 & results.pcR2(:,:,:,1) < 5);
improvement = results.pcR2(:,:,:,1+results.pcnum) - results.pcR2(:,:,:,1);

% Inspect amplitude estimates for the example voxel.  The first row shows results 
% obtained from the GLMdenoisedata call that does not involve global noise regressors;
% the second row shows results obtained from the regular GLMdenoisedata call.
% The left panels show amplitude estimates from individual bootstraps, whereas
% the right panels show the median and 68% interval across bootstraps (this 
% corresponds to the final model estimate and the estimated error on the
% estimate, respectively).

% Compare SNR before and after the use of global noise regressors.

% To ensure that the SNR values reflect only changes in the noise level, 
% we ignore the SNR computed in each individual GLMdenoisedata call and
% re-compute SNR, holding the numerator (the signal) constant across the
% two calls.  (Note: GLMdenoisedata automatically writes out a figure that
% shows a before-and-after SNR comparison (SNRcomparebeforeandafter.png).
% What is shown in this script does the comparison manually just for sake
% of example.)

% that are present in 'denoiseddata' can be customized (see opt.denoisespec
