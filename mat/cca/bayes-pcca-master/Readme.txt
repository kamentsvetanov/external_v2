Introduction

This program is an implementation of Bayesian Partial CCA and its variants.
This program is developed for the following paper:
    Yusuke Mukuta, Tatsuya Harada,
    "Probabilistic Partial Canonical Correlation Analysis",
    In International Conference on Machine Learning, 2014.
Please cite the paper if you use the code in a research.

When I implemented the code, I refer to r code of CCAGFA (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CCAGFA/index.html) for initialization.
It depends on Optimization Toolbox for optimizing rotation matrices. Please use different library or eliminate this part if you don't have this toolbox.
The calculation of inverse matrix may fail when the condition is too bad. In such a case, please add some regularization term.
Please read demo_causal.m and demo_modelselection.m to learn how to use the code.
