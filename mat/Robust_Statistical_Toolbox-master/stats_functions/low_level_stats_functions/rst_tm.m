function [trimmedMean,g]=rst_tm(x,percent)% function [trimmedMean,g]=tm(x,percent)%% Returns the trimmed mean of x as trimmedMean.% returns number of winsorized observations at each tail of sample as g% x must be a vector% percent must be a number between 0 and 100% The trimmed mean is calculated from x after dropping the lower and upper g values from% x, where g=floor((percent/100)*length(x)). If x is empty, then NaN is% returned.%% See Wilcox (2005), Introduction to Robust Estimation and Hypothesis% Testing (2nd Edition), Chapter 3, for a description of trimmed means.%% Original code provided by Prof. Patrick J.
